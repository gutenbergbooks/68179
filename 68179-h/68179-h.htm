<p class="dropcap">In attempting to illustrate the history of the
victory of Gideon, I am conscious that I am
entering on well-trodden ground. Others have
gathered the lessons and examined the types
with which that portion of the Scripture-field is so
richly studded. I lay claim to little originality of
thought on the subject which I have chosen. A humble
task has been mine; that of endeavouring to show that
the same faith by which heroes of old <i>out of weakness
were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to
flight the armies of the aliens</i>, is still, as the gift of God’s
grace, bestowed on the lowliest Christian. Writing, as
I have done, under the depressing influence of domestic
sorrow, and the languor of weak health, I feel how very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
imperfectly I have executed my task; but I humbly
commend my little work to Him who despiseth not the
feeble, and whose blessing on the humblest instrument
can make it effectual in His service.</p>

<p class="dropcap">“Home, once more at home!” how joyful sounded
the exclamation from the lips of Edith Lestrange,
and how brightly sparkled her eyes
as she uttered it, as, with a step light as a
fawn’s, she revisited each spot which five
years’ absence had only made more dear. With joyous
impatience she ascended the broad oaken staircase of
Castle Lestrange, to flit like a fairy from room to room,
lingering longest in the old nursery, where she had
known childhood’s pleasures, with not a few of its
sorrows—and the playroom, in which her toys were still
stored. There was the doll that had been to her as a
companion, to which the lonely little heiress had whispered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
many a trouble; the pretty picture-books, the
miniature tea-things of delicate china, that had been
such sources of amusement. It was a pleasure to Edith,
from recollections of “auld lang syne,” to touch and
handle these childish treasures, though at the age of
eleven she deemed herself no longer a child.</p>

<p>Then to the newly-returned traveller how great were
the delights of the garden and the park,—the one bright
with the flowers of spring, the other donning its light
green robe, while in the sheltered mossy dells fragrance
of violets filled the air. Edith almost wondered that
the light-footed deer should bound away on her approach:
her heart felt so full of joy and kindness, that
it seemed strange that any living creature should fear
her. The heiress of Lestrange took pleasure in visiting
the cottage of her father’s steward, where the familiar
faces of Holdich and his wife were as the faces of old
friends, bright with hearty welcome. Her canary, cared
for by Mrs. Holdich during her absence, was tamer than
ever, and its quivering notes of delight seemed to its
youthful mistress an echo of the music of happiness
which sounded within her own soul.</p>

<p>For Edith did not return to the castle of her ancestors
as she had left it five years before—a feeble, fragile
invalid. She no longer painfully dragged her weary
limbs along, with languor oppressing her spirits; springing
and elastic was the step which now bounded over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
the mossy turf. The cheeks that had been almost as
colourless as the snowdrop, had now a faint dawn of
colour upon them, like that on the opening buds of the
apple-blossom. Edith was still a delicate plant, like an
exotic reared in a hot-house, but an exotic skilfully
tended, expanding its petals in healthful life.</p>

<p>“Oh, how true it is that there is no place like home!”
exclaimed Edith, as she sauntered up the broad avenue,
with sunshine on her path, and the blue cloud-flecked
sky smiling above her.</p>

<p>The observation was addressed to her cousin, Isa
Gritton, who was spending a day at the Castle, a short
time after the return of Sir Digby Lestrange and his
daughter. Isa was a young lady whose age might be
about two or three and twenty, and who might therefore
have scarcely been deemed a suitable companion for one
so youthful as Edith, had not the little heiress possessed
a mind so early matured by the discipline of trial that
she was scarcely regarded as a child by those who intimately
knew her. Isa Gritton was a tall and graceful
girl, with auburn hair, and eyes like those of the
gazelle—large, soft, and expressive: mirroring each
passing emotion, whether it were that of mirth and
gladness, or, as was now the case, a shadow of painful
thought.</p>

<p>“Do you not feel with me,” said Edith, “that there
is a charm in the very name of <i>home</i>?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="500" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE COUSINS.</p>
</div>

<p>“I did so once,” replied Isa, with a sigh; “but for
the last two years, since the loss of my dear father, I
cannot be said to have had a real home.”</p>

<p>“But you have one now, dear Isa,” said Edith; “and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
oh, how glad I am that your brother chose to build one
at Wildwaste, so near us. Why, even I—who never
perform great feats in the walking line—will be able to
manage the distance on foot; it is barely a mile, I hear.
I dare say that Mr. Gritton kindly chose the site of his
house there on purpose that you might be near your
uncle and cousin. To meet you often, very often, will
be such a pleasure to me; I shall feel as if I had at last
what I have so often longed for, a sister to share all my
sorrows and joys. I will soon return your visit, and
you shall show me your brother’s new house. Has he
not built a charming retreat, with a pretty garden and
shrubbery round it?”</p>

<p>Isa Gritton laughed: but there was a little bitterness
in the laugh. “Tastes differ,” she replied; “and Gaspar
having been his own architect, he doubtless admires his
work. But my ideal of beauty is hardly realized by a
house that looks as if a geni had transplanted it bodily
from one of the smaller streets of London, in all the
newness of yellowish brick as yet undarkened by soot,
and had dropped it on the edge of a morass—not a tree
within half a mile of it—where it stands staring out
of its blindless windows as if wondering how it came
there, with nothing to remind it of London but the great
soap manufactory, which is the most conspicuous object
in the view, the smoke of which might do duty for that
of a whole street in the city.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>“How could Mr. Gritton build such a house, and in
such a place!” exclaimed Edith in surprise; “I could
not fancy you in a home that was not pretty and picturesque.
I have no clear remembrance of Wildwaste
save as a wide flat common sprinkled with gorse, for I
seldom or never visited the hamlet when I was a little
child.”</p>

<p>“You will scarcely care to visit it often now, except
out of compassion for me,” said Isa, smiling. “Mr.
Eardley tells me, however, that Wildwaste, bad as it is,
is greatly improved from what it was some years ago,
when it had nothing in the shape of a school.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Eardley—then you know him?” cried Edith,
brightening at the mention of the pastor whom she
reverenced and loved.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Isa; “though, Wildwaste not being in
the parish of Axe, we do not belong to his flock. Mr.
Eardley had heard, through your steward’s wife, I believe,
that we wanted a girl to help in the house. He
called to recommend to us a young protegée of his own,
a black-eyed gipsy-looking little creature, who blushes
scarlet when she is spoken to, and seems to be afraid of
the sound of her own voice. I think, however, that with
a little training Lottie Stone will suit us very well.”</p>

<p>“Do you not like Mr. Eardley?” said Edith, looking
as if assured that the answer must be in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“Very much; I wish that he were our clergyman instead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
of Mr. Bull, who must be nearly eighty years old,
and who—but I don’t think it well to criticize preachers.”</p>

<p>“We attend the service at Axe—we drive there, for
it is much too far off for a walk,” said Edith Lestrange.
“You shall come with us every Sunday—that is to say,”
she added, with a little hesitation, “if you don’t mind
leaving your brother. Papa does not like more than
three in the carriage.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I ought not to leave Gaspar,” said Isa,
gravely; and she added, but not aloud, “if I were not
with him, I fear that he would not go to a place of worship
at all.—No, Edith,” she said to her cousin, “I am
afraid that I cannot accompany you to Axe on Sundays,
but I have promised Mr. Eardley to bring Lottie twice
a week to the little cottage-lectures which he gives in the
dwelling of Holdich the steward.”</p>

<p>“Then we shall always meet there,” observed Edith.
“I have such a sweet remembrance of those cottage-meetings,
though I was such a little girl when I went
to them that of course I could not understand all that
I heard. I felt as if there were such peace, and holiness,
and Christian kindness in that quiet home-church, where
young and old, and rich and poor, gathered to hear God’s
truth, and pray and praise together. And Holdich himself
is such a good man,” continued Edith warmly: “it
is not merely that he does not mind openly confessing
his religion—whatever people may think of it—but that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
he lives up to what he professes. Papa went on the
Continent, you know, rather in haste, and there had
been a little confusion in his affairs, and no time to set
them right. Papa was always so generous, and those
about him had abused his confidence so sadly.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard something of that,” observed Isa, who,
like the rest of the world, was aware that Sir Digby’s
ostentatious extravagance had plunged him into pecuniary
difficulties, and that change of air for his invalid child,
though the ostensible, had not been the only cause of
his retreat.</p>

<p>“But Holdich has brought everything into such
beautiful order,” continued Edith,—“he has quite surprised
papa by the way in which he has managed the
estate. He has cared for his master’s interests as much,
I think <i>more</i> than if they had been his own. Papa used
to suspect people who had the name of being very pious,
but he said this morning at breakfast, ‘A man like my
steward, who brings his Christianity into his daily dealings,
does more to convince infidels of the real power of
faith than all the learned books that ever were written.’
I treasured up the words to repeat them to Holdich’s
wife. I think that she and her husband are the happiest
people that I know, and especially now that their
son is doing so well as a schoolmaster under Mr. Eardley.”</p>

<p>“The subject of the new series of cottage-lectures is
to be Gideon’s Triumph over Midian,” observed Isa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>“And the first is to begin at seven this evening,” said
Edith. “Papa has given me leave to be always present—at
least when the weather is fine; and some of our
servants will go too. They are not all able to get to
church on Sundays, for Axe is five miles from the
Castle.”</p>

<p>The cousins, slowly sauntering up the avenue, had
now reached a grassy mound at the end of it, on which
a tall weather-cock stood, and which might be ascended
by a flight of marble steps. Having mounted these
steps, a very extensive and beautiful prospect lay before
Isa and Edith, while a rural seat invited them to rest
and enjoy it.</p>

<p>“I have looked upon many lovely views in Italy,”
observed Edith, as her eye wandered with delight over
the scene; “but, to my mind, there is none to compare
with this. I always missed that dear little spire seen
in the distance yonder, where I knew that Sunday after
Sunday the real truth was preached in my own native
tongue by a servant of God. It always seems to me
with Mr. Eardley as if he were like the disciples, who
went to their Master and had their directions in the
morning straight from His lips; and that in the evening,
when his labour was over, he would go and ‘tell
Jesus’ all that he had done, and all that he had tried to
do—receive the Lord’s smile and His blessing, and then
lie down to rest at His feet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>“It seems so with some clergymen,” said Isa. “When
they feed the people with the bread of the Word, we
feel that they have just taken it from the hands of the
Lord—that He has given thanks, and blessed, and
broken it; so that we look from the servant to the
Master, and realize that the ministry of the gospel is
hallowed service indeed.”</p>

<h3>BROKEN BUBBLES.</h3>

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-s.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">“So you especially enjoyed your stay at Florence,”
said Isa, after the conversation had taken a
less serious turn.</p>

<p>“I was very happy there; it was so beautiful,
and we knew such very nice people. I should have
liked to have stayed there much longer.”</p>

<p>“And why did you not remain there?” asked Isa.
“Did not Sir Digby enjoy Florence too?”</p>

<p>“Very much indeed, until—until a lady came to stay
there who spoilt all his pleasure in the place.”</p>

<p>“How was that?” said Isa.</p>

<p>“Why, the lady was witty; at least people said so;
but if her kind of talking was wit, I wish that there
were no such thing in the world. All her delight
seemed to be to gossip and make her friends merry;
and so long as they laughed, she did not much mind
what they laughed at. You see,” continued Edith in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
confidential tone, “her mother had lived in the Castle,
and she talked a great deal about that. Now, of course,
it was quite right and noble in papa to let strangers
come here while we were away—and there had been
difficulties, as you know—but he did not like its being
talked about to every one.”</p>

<p>Isa could easily comprehend that her proud uncle had
been very sensitive on the subject of the letting of his
ancestral mansion.</p>

<p>“And then,” pursued Edith, “she mixed up what
was true with what was not true; and how could
strangers tell whether she spoke in jest or in earnest?
She said that papa had been harsh and violent to his
servants; and that was shamefully false!” exclaimed
the girl, with a flush of indignation on the face usually
so gentle and calm—“he had been only too indulgent
and trustful. In short, this lady made Florence so
unpleasant by her gossip, that papa could bear it no
longer. He said that he would never willingly be for a
day in the same city with Cora Madden.”</p>

<p>“Cora Madden!” repeated Isa, with a little start;
and Edith, who had been looking up at her cousin, saw
with surprise a stern, gloomy expression pass over her
countenance like a shadow.</p>

<p>“Do you know Miss Madden?” inquired the baronet’s
daughter.</p>

<p>“Do I know her?” repeated Isa slowly, with her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
hazel eyes bent on the ground. Then suddenly she
raised them, as she uttered the abrupt question, “Edith,
do you know what it is to hate?”</p>

<p>“Hate? no, not exactly,” replied the gentle girl;
“but there are some persons whom I do not like at all—some
with whom I feel angry at times. I was angry
with Miss Madden one day when she was laughing at
Mr. Eardley, and mimicking his manner. I thought her
doing so was so silly, so wrong. Besides, rudeness to
one’s friends tries one’s patience a great deal more than
unkindness to one’s self.”</p>

<p>“Cora reminds me of the description of the wicked
in the Psalms,” observed Isa—“‘<i>They shoot out their
arrows, even bitter words.</i>’ She cares little where the
darts alight, or how deep they may pierce.”</p>

<p>Edith, who had a very tender conscience, was very
doubtful whether such an application of a text from
Scripture was consistent with Christian charity. Without
venturing, however, to reprove, she merely observed
in her gentle tone, “I am sorry that I spoke of Cora at
all. It was breaking a rule which I had made.”</p>

<p>“What is your rule?” asked Isa.</p>

<p>“Never to speak of those whom I cannot like, except
to God,” replied Edith.</p>

<p>“And what do you say of them to God?”</p>

<p>“Oh, if I speak of them to God, I must speak <i>for</i>
them,” answered little Edith; “I dare not do anything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
else, for the Lord has told us to love our enemies, and
we could not bring malice into our prayers.”</p>

<p>“Yours is a good rule, darling,” said Isa, and she
turned to imprint a kiss on the forehead of her cousin.
“Let us speak no more of Cora Madden, and may God
help us to obey the most difficult command contained
in all the Bible!”</p>

<p>To explain why the command appeared such a hard
one to the young maiden—why the very name of Cora
called up bitter remembrances to her mind—it is needful
that I should let the reader know something of the
previous history of Isa Gritton.</p>

<p>Like her cousin Edith, Isa had early lost her mother,
and had been the only daughter in her father’s home;
but otherwise there had been little resemblance between
the early childhood of the two. Edith, a crippled, suffering
invalid, had been the unmurmuring victim of
nursery oppression; and in her splendid mansion had
had more to endure than many of the children of the
poor. Isa, on the contrary, fondly tended by a devoted
nurse, herself strong, vigorous, and full of spirits, had
found her childhood flow pleasantly past, like a stream
dimpling in sunshine and bordered with flowers. Isa
had scarcely known what it was to feel weary, sick, or
sad. Her father called her his little lark, made only to
sing and to soar. She was beloved by all who knew
the bright, playful child, and her affectionate nature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
disposed her to love all in return. The religion which
was carefully instilled into Isa partook of the joyful
character of her mind. Isa was troubled by no doubts
and few fears. The thoughts of heaven and bliss which
were suggested to her, were congenial to the spirit of
the child. Isa looked forward to the joys of Paradise
without letting imagination dwell either on the dark
valley or “the narrow stream.” Her idea of death was
simply a peaceful removal to a yet brighter and happier
home.</p>

<p>There were some spiritual dangers attending this
existence of ease and joy. The very sweetness of Isa’s
disposition dimmed her perception of inward corruption.
If she was tempted to make an idol of self, it was an
idol so fair that she scarcely recognized it as one.
Sometimes, indeed, Isa’s conscience would accuse her of
vanity as she lingered before her mirror, surveying with
girlish pleasure the smiling image within it, or recalled
words of fond admiration, or committed some little extravagance
in regard to dress, for Isa at that time had a
weakness for dress. But the accusation was made in a
whisper so soft, that it scarcely disturbed her serenity.
It affected her conduct, however; for on the day when
Isa first received a regular allowance of her own, she
made on her knees a resolution which never was broken—not
to spend money on the adornment of her person
without devoting an equal sum to the relief of the poor.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Thus early the love of God combated the love of the
world; a bridle was placed upon vanity, which was still
but a bridle of flowers; for Isa felt as much pleasure in
helping the poor as in wearing a new robe, or in clasping
the jewelled bracelet round her soft white arm.</p>

<p>Isa’s brightness of spirit did not pass away with
childhood; it rather increased, as the bud expands into
the perfect flower. But in life’s school Providence has
appointed various teachers, and few of God’s children
pass many years upon earth without coming under the
discipline of disappointment, bereavement, and care.
Isa was to know all three. The first came to her when
the blooming girl felt herself at the very summit of
earthly bliss, when a halo of happiness was thrown
around every object near her. Isa believed herself to
be the most blest of women in being beloved by Lionel
Madden. Young and inexperienced as she was, Isa’s
fancy invested her hero with every noble and sterling
quality; she believed all that she desired, and the bright
bubbles blown by hope glittered with all the prismatic
tints of the rainbow. The bubble suddenly broke!
Lionel became cold, alienated, shortly after the arrival
of his sister, who seemed to have taken an instinctive
dislike to Isa. What had been said against her Isa
never exactly knew; but whatever poisoned shaft had
destroyed her hopes, she knew that it came from the
quiver of Cora. What marvel if bitter, resentful feelings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
arose towards the author of her deep, though
hidden, anguish? As Isa’s gaiety was suddenly
changed into gloom, so her kindly loving nature for
awhile seemed altered into one sternly vindictive. Like
Satan intruding in a paradise of peace, and blighting its
flowers by his presence, hatred, and even a lurking desire
for vengeance, suddenly arose in a soul which had previously
appeared to be formed only for happiness and love.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="500" height="625" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CHANGED AFFECTION.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>But had Cora really injured Isa? Nay; the malicious
enemy had done more to shield the young maiden
from misfortune than her most tender friend could have
done. Cruel may be the hand which tears to pieces the
half-formed nest which a bird is building on a hedge by
the wayside, but it is well for the bird if it be thus
constrained to choose a higher and safer bough. Lionel
was unworthy of the affection of a faithful, confiding
young heart. It was well for Isa that her bubble was
broken, that her cherished hopes were scattered to the
winds. She did not think so, she could not feel so;
even Lionel’s very worldly marriage, which took place a
few months afterwards, did not fully open her eyes to
this truth. Isa deemed all that was unworthy in the
conduct of young Madden the result of the influence of
his sister; and regarded Cora not only as her own evil
genius, but that of the man whom she had loved.
Startled and alarmed by the fierce passions which, for
the first time, struggled for the possession of her heart,
Isa looked upon Cora as the cause not only of misery,
but of sin also. Isa’s self-knowledge was deepened by
trial, but it was a self-knowledge that mortified and
pained her. She found that she was far from what she
had hoped to become, from what the world believed her
to be; she was no calm angel soaring above earth and
its trials, but a weak tempted woman, who found it hard
not to murmur, and almost impossible truly to forgive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>And yet Cora had been but an instrument in a
higher Hand, and to Isa an instrument for good. We
may praise God in another world even more for the
malice of our bitter enemies, than for the tender love of
our friends. Jacob’s paternal affection would have
shielded his best-beloved son from every touch of misfortune;
but it was the hatred of Joseph’s brethren, the
malice of his false accuser, that led him—through the
pit and the prison—to exaltation and to honour. Satan
himself became, through God’s over-ruling goodness, an
instrument of blessing to Job; his cruel assaults led to
deeper experience in the man whom he sought to destroy,
more close communion with God, and doubtless
more exalted blessedness hereafter. No enemy, human
or infernal, has power to do us aught but <i>good</i>, except by
leading us into sin. Could we realize this, our wounded
hearts might find it less difficult to forgive the wrongs
which are “blessings in disguise.”</p>

<p>Not a year after the stroke of disappointment had
fallen upon Isa, she had to endure that of sudden bereavement.
A few—very few—days of anxious watching
by a parent’s sick-bed, and Isa found herself fatherless
as well as motherless in the world. Very heavy lay
the burden of loneliness upon the young orphan’s heart.
It is true that Isa had a half-brother yet living, but
Gaspar was many years older than herself, and Isa had
seen very little of him, as the greater part of his life had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
been passed in Jamaica. Still the affections of Isa clung
fondly around the nearest relative left for her to love,
especially as she knew her brother to be in broken
health; and she resolved that to watch over him and
minister to his comfort should be the object thenceforth
of an existence from which all the brightness appeared
to have departed.</p>

<p>Even with thoughts of Gaspar, however, were linked
associations of mystery and pain. Isa had never imparted
to any one a care which to her young spirit was
more oppressive than sorrow itself. She had never told
how, when the shadow of approaching dissolution lay
on her father, when the delirium of fever had passed
away, he had fixed his glazing eyes upon his daughter,
at that midnight hour the sole watcher beside him.
The dying man had seemed anxious to disburden himself
of something that weighed on his mind; he struggled
to speak, but his parched lips could scarcely frame articulate
words. Isa strained her ear to catch the almost
inaudible accents, bending down so low that she could
feel the dying man’s breath on her cheek. A few scattered
sentences were gathered, deeply imprinted on her
memory by the solemnity of the time when they were
uttered.</p>

<p>“Gaspar—you will be with him—something wrong—the
<i>Orissa</i>—not her money lost—he should deal fairly
by that orphan—tell him from me—” But whatever was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
the message intended, death silenced the lips that would
have sent it, and Isa was left to ponder painfully over
what could be “wrong,” and how Gaspar could have not
“dealt fairly” by an orphan, at least in the opinion of
his father.</p>

<p>The remembrance of these dying words, the dread of
some painful explanation with Gaspar, alone threw a
damp upon the earnest desire with which Isa looked forward
to her only brother’s return to England. Her
affectionate spirit yearned for the sympathy of one bound
to her by the tie of blood, and she longed once more to
possess a settled home. About a year after Mr. Gritton’s
death, Gaspar arrived from Jamaica. Isa was at the
time residing with a friend in London, and her brother
took a lodging near her. Being a good deal occupied
with business during the day, and too much an invalid
to venture out in the evening, Gaspar did not see much
of his sister,—far less than Isa desired. Her brother’s
manner towards her was gentle and courteous, his kindness
won her gratitude, his broken health her sympathy.
Isa wished to devote herself to the care of her brother,
but he preferred delaying the time when they should
reside together in a settled home, until he should have
built a house into which he could receive his young
sister. During this period spent in London, Isa either
found no opportunity of speaking to Gaspar on the subject
of their father’s mysterious message, or she put off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
making the effort till a more quiet season, when her
brother might have recovered his health. She could not
bear to risk exciting him when he was so delicate, or
offending him when he was so kind. Isa gladly availed
herself of any excuse to delay the performance of a duty
from which she intuitively shrank.</p>

<p>Isa felt grateful to her half-brother for selecting as the
place of their future residence a spot near Castle Lestrange.
She had paid many a delightful visit to her
uncle’s lordly mansion, both before and after the death
of his wife, and she deemed it a proof of Gaspar’s considerate
affection for herself, that he should purchase a
site for his house but a mile from the dwelling of those
who were her relatives, but not his own. Isa could
have wished, indeed, that it had not been on the Wildwaste
side of the Castle, as memory recalled a flat expanse
of common surrounding a miserable hamlet, and
an unsightly manufactory; but she had not visited her
uncle’s home for nearly six years, and many changes
might have taken place during that period. Isa also
encouraged herself with the thought that a little paradise
might stand even in the midst of a barren heath,
like an oasis in a desert; and that as Gaspar had chosen
to build a house instead of buying one, it was evident
that his was a taste which could not be satisfied by any
ordinary attractions in a dwelling.</p>

<p>During the time when Gaspar was building, Isa never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
once saw her brother. He took a lodging above the
single shop in Wildwaste, that he might superintend
operations. He kept a sharp eye over the workmen
who were brought from London, not suffering them, it
was said, to mix with the cottagers around, or spend
their evenings at the small county inn. There was no
doubt that Gaspar Gritton was eccentric, and Isa was
aware of the fact; but she was disposed to look at her
only brother in the most favourable light, and persuaded
herself that she rather liked a dash of eccentricity in a
character; it redeemed it from being commonplace.</p>

<p>Isa was very impatient for the completion of her new
home, and would, if permitted, have entered it before
it was sufficiently dry to be a safe residence for her.
Buoyant hope had again sprung up within her young
heart, long cast down, but not crushed by affliction.
Life might yet have joys in store for the bright girl.
Isa would be, as she thought, everything to her brother;
his nurse, companion, and friend. She would make his
home a fairy dwelling, where everything on which the
eye might rest should be graceful and pretty. Isa knew
that her brother had sufficient means to procure every
comfort; and though her own patrimony was but slender,
she hoped, dispensing Gaspar’s alms, to become a
benefactress to all the poor around them. Again the
fairy bubble was glittering before Isa, and if its colours
were now less splendid, and it rose to less lofty a height<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
still the emblem of earthly hope was not without its
beauty and brightness.</p>

<p>It was on a day in March that Isa joined her brother.
She had enjoyed her journey by train; the sunshine had
been brilliant, her companions agreeable, and her mind
was full of pleasant expectation. Isa’s pleasure was
damped by the little disappointment of not finding Gaspar
ready to welcome her at the station. It was with
a sensation of loneliness that she took her seat in a hired
open conveyance to be driven to Wildwaste Lodge. The
sunshine was now overclouded, a fierce north-east wind
was blowing, from the chilling effects of which the young
lady from London tried to protect herself in vain. The
horse was lame, the drive seemed long.</p>

<p>“Are we far from Wildwaste Lodge?” asked Isa at
last of the driver, as they skirted a dreary common of
which she fancied that she could recognize some of the
features.</p>

<p>“That be’s the house,” replied the man, pointing with
his whip towards a narrow three-storied dwelling, looking
staringly new, without sheltering shrubbery or even
hedge, with no blinds to the windows, no porch to the
door, nothing that could redeem its aspect from absolute
vulgarity. Could this be the rural retreat to which Isa
had given the name of home!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="500" height="425" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ISA’S ARRIVAL AT WILDWASTE.</p>
</div>

<p>Disheartened and chilled felt Isa as her conveyance
passed through the wretched hamlet, where groups of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
untidy women and barefooted children stood staring at
the unwonted apparition of anything in the shape of a
carriage. She scarcely liked to look again at the house,
as the lame horse stopped at the dark green door. Gaspar
did not come forth to welcome her; he dared not
face the cutting wind which had chilled his sister to the
heart. Cold and numbed after her journey, Isa—when
a deaf elderly woman had answered the knock—descended
from the conveyance; herself saw her boxes
carried into the narrow hall by the driver, paid the man
and dismissed him, and then hastened into the parlour,
where she found her brother. His reception, though not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
uncourteous, was by no means calculated to dispel the
chill which had fallen on the spirits of Isa. Gaspar was
so full of his own complaints that he had scarcely leisure
to observe that his sister was tired and cold. After
conversing with him for a while, Isa arose to explore the
other apartments of the house. She suppressed a little
sigh of disappointment as she ascended the uncarpeted
stair.</p>

<p>The interior of Wildwaste Lodge was, if possible, more
unattractive than its outward appearance. Gaspar had
reserved the ground-floor for himself, and no one had a
right to complain if in his own peculiar domain he preferred
simplicity to ornament, and neglected the little
elegancies which Isa deemed almost essential to comfort.
But Isa was deeply mortified when she entered her own
apartments, which were immediately over those of her
brother, and found them furnished with a regard to
economy which amounted to actual penuriousness. A
few chairs, not one of which matched another, and which
seemed to have been chosen at haphazard out of some
broker’s shop; a table of painted wood, one of the legs
of which did not touch the uncarpeted floor; and a shelf
to serve as a bookcase: these formed the entire furniture
of the young lady’s boudoir. There was not so
much as a curtain to the window. Isa, weary and
chilled after her journey, felt inclined to sit down and
cry from mortification and disappointment. Little joy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
could she anticipate from a life to be passed with one
who from the first showed such disregard for her pleasure
and comfort.</p>

<p>Isa’s misgivings were painfully realized. There are
some persons who are pleasing in society, agreeable
when only met on casual occasions, with whom it is
very annoying to be brought into closer contact. It is
trying to the temper to transact business with them,
still more trying to dwell under the same roof. The
character of such persons seems to be made up of angles,
that on every side chafe and annoy. A graphic writer<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
has humorously described them as unpruned trees.
“Little odd habits, the rudiments of worse habits, need
every now and then to be cut off and corrected. We
should all grow very singular, ridiculous, and unamiable
creatures, but for the pruning we have got from hands
kind and unkind, from our earliest days.... Perhaps
you have known a man who has lived for forty years
alone; and you know what odd shoots he had sent out;
what strange traits and habits he had acquired; what
singular little ways he had got into. There had been
no one at home to prune him, and the little shoots of
eccentricity, of vanity, of vain self-estimation, that might
have easily been cut off when they were green and soft,
have now grown into rigidity.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gritton, from living much alone, had become a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
man of this kind. The most unsightly branch on the
unpruned tree was that of penuriousness. Isa had had
little opportunity of knowing her brother’s infirmity
until, when she became a resident in his house, it affected
her daily, her hourly, comfort. Herself generous and
open-handed, fond of having the conveniences and elegancies
of life around her, yet esteeming as the greatest
of luxuries the power of giving freely to others, Isa could
not understand, far less sympathize with, the love of
money for money’s sake, which was the leading characteristic
of Gaspar. It seemed to her so grovelling, so mean,
that Isa had to struggle against emotions not only of
irritation but of contempt. She was also deeply wounded
to find that Gaspar’s affection for his only sister was so
subordinate to his avarice. The young lady, accustomed
to luxury and refinement, had the utmost difficulty in
persuading her brother even to allow her to find an
assistant to the ill-tempered elderly woman whom he
had engaged as a general servant. Though Isa succeeded
in gaining her point, Mr. Gritton would only
give such wages as would be accepted by none but an
inexperienced girl like Lottie Stone. The efforts which
it cost Isa to carry out even this small domestic arrangement
made her aware of another unpleasant fact—that
Gaspar had a peevish, irritable temper, more trying to
one residing constantly with him than a passionate one
would have been. The dying charge of her father lay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
now like an oppressive weight upon the heart of poor
Isa: her new insight into the character of Gaspar gave
to their parent’s words a more forcible meaning, and she
dreaded more and more the idea of being compelled by a
sense of duty to open the subject to her brother.</p>

<p>The first weeks of Isa’s residence at her dreary home
would have been weeks of positive misery, but for the
cheering prospect of the speedy return of her uncle and
cousin, and the comfort which she derived from the visits
of the pastor of Axe, whose fatherly interest in her young
servant had first led his steps to her dwelling. Smiling
April came at last; and with it—more welcome to Isa
than the nightingale’s song—Edith Lestrange returned
to the Castle. It was now arranged that Isa should
pass with her cousin a portion of each of those days on
which an evening lecture should be held at the steward’s
cottage, and return to Wildwaste in the baronet’s carriage
at night. It was something to Isa to be thus sure
of at least two pleasant days in the week; though the
contrast between the refined elegance of Edith’s home
and the dreary discomfort of her own, increased the
sense of bitterness in the soul of Isa.</p>

<p>But that sense of bitterness seemed for a time to pass
away, and domestic trials to be forgotten, when the
cousins entered together the flower-covered porch of the
dwelling of Holdich, to unite with their poorer brethren
in the simple cottage service. Edith’s heart was overflowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
with thankful delight at being permitted again
to worship in that place where some of her earliest impressions
of religion had been received. Isa felt that
here at least the carking cares of life might be shut out:
she might lift up her soul, as in happier days, unto her
Father in heaven.</p>

<p>The subject chosen by Mr. Eardley was the history of
the triumph of Gideon, the hero and saint, over the
hosts of Midian. It was his object in this, as in former
courses of lectures,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> to draw simple practical lessons from
the narratives contained in the Word of God; and as
such lessons are required by us all, I shall weave the
brief addresses of the clergyman, though in separate
chapters, into the web of my story.</p>

<h3>LECTURE I.—MIDIANITES IN POSSESSION.</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-f.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">For forty years after Deborah had celebrated the
triumph over Sisera in her glorious song, the
land of Israel had had rest. This period of
tranquillity receives such brief mention in the
Scriptures, that we are in danger of forgetting
for how long a time God granted the blessing of peace.
And thus is it in our own lives, my brethren: times of
trouble stand out, as it were, like rugged crags, shutting
out from memory’s view the vines and the fig-trees, the
olive-yards, the green pastures and still waters, with
which our gracious God for long may have blessed us.</p>

<p>Seven years of trouble to Israel succeeded the forty
years of repose: not <i>causeless</i> trouble—such is never
known in the experience either of Israelite or of Christian.
But we do not always search out the actual cause
of affliction. With God’s ancient people the punishment
was clearly traced to the sin. When the Midianites,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
like a swarm of locusts, came up against them, destroying
and wasting, driving the inhabitants of the land to
hide in dens of the mountains, strongholds, and caves, it
was because the stain of idolatry lay upon Israel; and
mercy, to save the sinners, required that justice should
chastise the sin.</p>

<p>The Midianites, who were thus made an instrument of
punishment to Israel, were, like themselves, descendants
of Abraham, but by his union with Keturah. When
Moses guided God’s people towards Canaan, the Midianites
drew down vengeance on themselves by their too
successful efforts to lead Israel into sin. Then perished
the wicked prophet Balaam amongst the enemies of
God’s people. But Midian, though punished, had not
been destroyed; and now, after the lapse of nearly two
hundred years, we find it a very powerful nation, against
whose numerous hordes the Israelites seem to have made
no attempt to defend their homes—so completely was
the warlike spirit crushed in the descendants of those
who had triumphed under Moses and Joshua when they
fought the battles of the Lord.</p>

<p>When the Israelites were in trouble, then they cried
aloud to the God of their fathers, and He heard and
answered their prayer: not yet by sending a deliverer—the
sense of sin must be deepened before the judgment
be removed. A prophet was sent to the people, with a
message, not of promise, but of reproof:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>“Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I brought you
up from Egypt, and brought you forth from the land of
bondage, and I delivered you out of the hand of the
Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed
you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you
their land. And I said unto you, I am the Lord your
God; fear not the gods of the Amorites in whose land
ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed My voice.”</p>

<p>The great and glorious deliverance of Israel from
Egypt we may regard as a type of the redemption of
Christ’s Church from the dominion of Satan—the
triumph achieved once and for ever by the mysterious
sufferings of our Saviour, His sacrifice offered upon the
Cross. This is the <i>central truth</i> of the Christian religion.
But though Egyptian darkness be left behind—though
Christians be received into the enjoyment of privileges
purchased by the death of their Lord—their backslidings,
like those of Israel, often draw upon them heavy
troubles, resembling the devouring hordes of Midian.</p>

<p>I am not, my brethren, speaking of the afflictions and
bereavements which are the common lot of all. During
the forty years of blessed peace, sickness and sorrow
must have been known in homes of Israel, and faithful
servants of God have wept over new-made graves. Such
trials are crosses appointed by a heavenly Father—crosses
which each and all must take up at some period
of life, if life be not early cut short. But I am speaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
of troubles directly or indirectly brought on us by our
sins: the Midianites who destroy our peace, and bring
upon us miseries from which more earnest faith, more
perfect obedience, might have preserved us. We are
accustomed to speak of this life as “a vale of tears;”
but let us search and examine whether the valley owe
not the greater part of its desolation and gloom to foes
to our peace whom <i>we might have kept out</i>, and over
whom faith may yet give us a victory glorious as that
of Gideon.</p>

<p>To explain my meaning more clearly, let me draw
your attention to a few of what we may call chiefs—leaders
of hordes of troubles, Midianites in the heart,
that trample down our happiness and destroy our comfort
in life. I shall mention four names but too familiar—Disappointment,
Discontent, Dissension, Distrust. Let
us see whether the sufferings which they inflict are not
more severe and perpetual than those brought upon us
by what are called visitations of Providence; whether
many griefs which we term “crosses” are not rather
burdens laid upon us by enemies to the soul, to whose
yoke we should never have stooped.</p>

<p>The first Midianite chief whom I shall bring before
you is Disappointment—the intruder who cuts down the
green crop of hope, and leaves a famine in the soul.
Whence is it that even the Christian is constantly subject
to disappointment? Is it not from habitual disobedience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
to the divine command, <i>Set your affections
upon things above, not on things beneath</i>? We eagerly
fix our heart on some worldly object—ambition, pleasure,
or gain: like children, we build our houses of delight
on the sand within reach of the tide, which must sooner
or later sweep them away, and then sit down and weep
when the flood rolls over the spot which we had unwisely
chosen. Let each of us who in the bitterness of disappointment
has mournfully repeated the words of the
Preacher, <i>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity</i>, see whether
the idol in the heart has not been the cause of the
Midianites’ invasion; and whether that faith which
builds on the Rock of Ages, beyond the reach of desolation
or decay, may not yet overcome the power of disappointment
to harass the soul. Hopes fixed upon
Christ know not disappointment; treasures laid up in
heaven can never be lost; ties formed by faith endure
throughout eternity; the less our joys are of the earth,
earthy, the less danger there is that the spoiler can ever
wrest them away from our grasp.</p>

<p>And whence cometh Discontent, who robs his slave of
all his peace?—for peace and discontent cannot abide in
the same soul. Can he who says to his most bountiful
God, not only with his lips but from his heart, “I am
unworthy of the least of Thy mercies,” ever know discontent?
Must not the peevish, envious, rebellious
spirit be ever kept far from his gates? We should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
deem so; and yet, Christian brethren, do we practically
find that it is so? Are we not too often inclined to
compare our lot with that of others, and, if not openly,
yet secretly, repine, as if Providence had done us a
wrong? No true servant of Christ can desire to have
his portion here; and yet does not the inheritor of
heaven too frequently murmur because not all the good
things of earth are showered upon him in addition?
How different his spirit from that of the apostle! He
who had <i>suffered the loss of all things</i>, yet could affirm,
<i>I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be
content</i>. Had we also learned this lesson, we should
find it less impracticable to obey his command, <i>Rejoice
in the Lord alway; and again I say unto you, rejoice</i>.</p>

<p>“You have not your due,” were the words which I
once heard a wife address to a husband who had been
deprived of some advantage which she considered to
have been his right. “Nay, God be praised that I
have not my <i>due</i>,” he replied. “What is my <i>due</i> as a
sinner before God? what is my due from a world which
I have renounced for His sake? Had I chosen my
portion in this life, then only might I complain of not
receiving my due!” Here was a man whom discontent
could not rob of his heritage of peace.</p>

<p>To pass on to Dissension, the third enemy to our happiness,
who invades many a home, and makes goodly
dwellings miserable abodes,—to what shall we trace his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
invasion? Is it not written in Scripture, <i>By pride
cometh contention</i>?—would not the <i>soft answer</i> that
<i>turneth away wrath</i> often prove as a strong bar to keep
him from entering our habitations? But here I must
guard myself from being misunderstood. It is possible
that dissension may come where the fault lies on one
side alone. The Christian may be—not unfrequently is—called
to brave opposition, and draw upon himself the
anger of men by defending the truth, or taking up the
cause of the oppressed. The command, <i>Live peaceably
with all men</i>, is qualified by <i>if it be possible</i>; for in
some cases it is <i>not</i> possible to preserve harmony without
giving up principle. Under such circumstances the
sacrifice of peace is a sacrifice for God, and the cross is
one which is borne for His sake. But in the majority
of cases dissension follows on the footsteps of pride, and
is the leader of malice, hatred, and all uncharitableness.
Then, indeed, is he the true Midianite who pours gall
into the very springs of enjoyment, who casts his
venomed arrows on every side, and maketh a wilderness
of that which might have been as the Garden of
Eden. <i>Better a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
stalled ox and hatred therewith.</i> Could we, through
the grace of God’s Spirit, purge from our souls all malice,
all bitterness and wrath—could we love one another as
Christ hath loved us, what heart-burnings, what heart-achings
might be spared, and how often would the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
brightness of heaven appear to be reflected even upon
earth!</p>

<p>Disappointment, Discontent, and Dissension have, as
we have seen, much to do with the train of sorrows
which have given to God’s fair world the name of “a
vale of tears.” But I believe that the most dangerous
enemy of all to our peace, the one who has most often
pressed his iron yoke on the hearts of my hearers, is the
fourth whose name I have mentioned, Distrust of the
love and wisdom of God. This assertion may cause
surprise in those who are unconscious of a doubt; but
examine yourselves closely, my brethren, observe what
has most often clouded your brows, saddened your
spirits, drawn the deep sigh from your hearts. Has it
been regrets for the past? Has it been the trials of the
present? Has it not rather been care for the future,
fears of what the morrow might bring? Would not perfect
obedience to the injunction of our blessed Redeemer,
<i>Take no thought for the morrow</i>, sweep away at once
more than half of the troubles that weigh on our souls?</p>

<p>And why take thought for the morrow? We too often
appear to forget that the future lies in the hand of One
“too wise to err, too good to be unkind.” We act as if
we could not, or would not, believe that <i>all things work
together for good to them that love God</i>: we are needlessly
restless, anxious, unhappy, and exclaim in our trouble,
“How heavy a rod the Lord lays upon me!” Nay, poor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
weak unbelieving heart, thou art smitten less by the rod
of thy Father, than by the scourge of the Midianite within.
If faith could drive out mistrust, if thou couldst in deed
and in truth cast thy cares upon Him who careth for thee,
then—even here—might God give thee <i>beauty for ashes,
the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for
the spirit of heaviness</i>. Perfect trust would bring perfect
submission, and the peace that passeth understanding.</p>

<p>Gideon, the future deliverer of Israel, first appears
before us in Scripture engaged in threshing corn beside
the wine-press in order to hide it from the rapacious
Midianites who held possession of the land. From the
necessity of concealment he cannot employ, after the
custom of the East, his father’s oxen to trample out the
wheat; he must himself wield the flail with the strength
of his own right arm. Gideon is employed in a task of
lowly toil, unconscious at first of the presence of the
heavenly Being who has descended to earth, and who is
now beside him under the shadow of the oak at Ophrah.
And here for the present we will pause, and defer till
our next meeting the consideration of God’s merciful
promise to Gideon, and the effect which it produced on
his soul. If we regard Faith under the emblem of a
tree, we have hitherto viewed it as such tree may appear
in winter, when there is not a blossom on the bough or
a leaf on the spray. There is no outward evidence of
life; and though we hope that spring will draw up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
sap, and clothe the bare branches with beauty, we see
no present sign of the change. Such may have been
the state of Gideon’s faith when he thought on the
sufferings of his miserable country. The flail of the
Lord was upon it, but we know from the result that it
was not to crush—not to destroy the wheat, but to
separate the chaff from the grain, and so render the
latter more fit for reception into the garner of the Lord.</p>

<h3>THE LITTLE MAID.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-g.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Good-bye, Isa dearest, we shall often—very
often meet,” were the parting words of Edith
that night.</p>

<p>Wrapped up warmly for protection from
the cold air, Isa descended the steps beneath
the lofty portico of the Castle, and entered the
luxurious carriage which her uncle had placed at her
command. As she sank on the soft cushions, a dreary,
aching sensation came over her heart; she felt as if she
were leaving brightness, happiness, beauty behind her,
and going to an abode of trial—almost privation—which
she could hardly regard as a home.</p>

<p>“It is wrong, very wrong in me to feel thus,” Isa
murmured to herself. “If visits to the Castle make me
discontented, the fewer they are the better; but it seems
to me that my only happy time now will be the time
spent with Edith. I have nothing at the Castle to wear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
my spirits, or chafe my temper, my cousin is so sweet,
my uncle so kind,—when under their roof I seem to be
able to shut out disappointment and care. Ah! that
word disappointment, it reminds me of the cottage-lecture
which I heard this evening. Are the Midianites in possession
of my heart? Are my crosses—what I have
deemed crosses—rather burdens laid upon me by enemies,
under whose yoke I should never have stooped?”</p>

<p>As the carriage rolled on through the darkness, Isa
pursued the train of her reflections. Disappointment,
Discontent, Dissension, Distrust, the Midianites in the
soul—was she now harbouring them in her own? Isa
could not bear to let her mind dwell long upon the
first; even now, after the lapse of years, when she had
had too good cause to believe that the idol which she
had raised in her heart had been of clay, Isa dare hardly
own to herself that Lionel had been unworthy of her
love, and that his love had not been enduring, because
it had contained no element of immortality. Shrinking
from close self-examination on a subject so tender, Isa
passed on to that of Discontent; painfully aware as she
was that that spirit was struggling within her breast,
that she was tempted to regard her present lot with
emotions of bitterness amounting almost to rebellion.</p>

<p>“Saints have been content in poverty, serene in suffering,
joyful in tribulation,—they have made even dungeon-walls
echo to their hymns of praise,” thought Isa, “and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
here am I, with youth, health, competence, kind friends,
blessings unnumbered and undeserved,—here am I, cast
down, irritable, murmuring, and depressed, because I
dwell in a house which does not suit my taste, but
which is a thousand times more comfortable than those
inhabited by most of my poor fellow-creatures. I am annoyed
at a little petulance from an invalid brother, while
many, better than myself, have to endure harshness
amounting to cruelty, hatred, persecution, and scorn.
How have I merited that my trials should be so much
lighter than theirs? Have I any cause to murmur?
have I any right to complain? Is it well that I should
compare my lot with that of the few, instead of that of
the many, and give place to ungrateful discontent instead
of thanking God that He has bestowed upon me so much
more than my due? Why should my thoughts dwell
on Edith’s happiness instead of on the misery that I see
yet nearer to me in the squalid homes of Wildwaste? I
must go more amongst the poor; yes, in so doing I shall
not only obey God’s command, but find weapons against
the intrusion of sinful discontent.</p>

<p>“Dissension! I can scarcely say that there is that in
my home, though there is, I fear, but little of true affection;
and words of impatience and looks of coldness
make life’s road seem very rough!” The simile was
probably suggested to Isa’s mind by the jolting motion
of the carriage, for the smooth gravel drive through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
baronet’s grounds was now exchanged for the rough road
across the common, which was seldom traversed except
by the carts, which had left deep ruts in the boggy soil.
“But what was the cause of that intensely bitter feeling
which arose to-day—which always arises in my mind at
the bare mention of Cora Madden? Why should the
remembrance of her be sufficient to drive away the
holiest and happiest thoughts? Surely the Midianites
are within, hatred, malice—nay, I almost fear the spirit
of revenge! I sometimes feel such an intense—such an
unholy longing for retribution to come upon that woman,
that she should taste some of the bitterness of the cup
of misery which she has caused me to drink! And are
such longings consistent with Christianity? do they not
arise from the influence of the spirit of evil? While
such emotions are harboured in my heart, can there ever
be peace within? God help me, for my strength is as
weakness against such a Midianite as this!</p>

<p>“And Distrust”—here Isa’s meditations were suddenly
brought to a close by her arrival at Wildwaste
Lodge. The loud, authoritative knock which broke in
such an unusual manner the stillness which had pervaded
that dull tenement brought Lottie Stone running in haste
to the door. She was a shy, black-eyed little maiden,
who looked up in timid awe at Sir Digby’s tall footman
in his splendid livery, but greeted her young mistress
with a smile of rustic simplicity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>“Has your master gone to rest yet?” asked Isa.</p>

<p>“Not yet; he’s a-waiting for you in the study.”</p>

<p>Isa entered her brother’s almost unfurnished apartment.
One dull candle threw faint light on bare walls,
and a table and chairs that would have looked shabby
in a farm-house. On one of the latter (there were but
three) was seated Gaspar Gritton. He was a man still
in the prime of life, but the sallow complexion and stoop
consequent on protracted ill health, made him look
several years older than he in reality was. Gaspar had
been rather handsome in youth, and still his features,
though contracted, were good; but his eye was dull,
and the whole expression of his face unpleasing: it was
marked by dissatisfaction and peevishness, and more so
than usual as Isa entered his study.</p>

<p>“I wish that you would tell those fellows not to startle
one by such thundering raps,” said the invalid brother.</p>

<p>“I am sorry that the knock disturbed you; its loudness
was certainly disproportioned to the occasion,” replied
Isa, good-humouredly, as she seated herself by her
brother; “I will tell John to announce my return in a
more modest manner next time.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why you should come in a carriage at
all. You might have walked home with Lottie and
Mrs. Bolder after the meeting was over; the night is
perfectly fine. I expected you before half-past eight,
and now it is almost eleven.” Gaspar took a pinch of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
snuff to soothe his aggrieved feelings, this being the sole
luxury in which he habitually indulged; his doing so
happened unfortunately to be particularly disagreeable
to Isa.</p>

<p>“My uncle kindly wished me to stay the evening
with himself and Edith, and to pass every day on which
lectures are given with them at the Castle,” said Isa.</p>

<p>“Gadding—always gadding; girls are never satisfied
at home,” observed Gaspar with a sneer.</p>

<p>Isa felt irritated and inclined to make a retort, but
she suppressed the words on her tongue, and replied as
cheerfully as she could,—</p>

<p>“You cannot wonder at my liking to meet with some
of my nearest relations; and were I to see absolutely
nothing beyond our Wildwaste domain, I might grow as
antiquated and whimsical as Robinson Crusoe himself.
But I fear that you have passed but a dull evening
without Isa to sing or read to you, Gaspar.”</p>

<p>The ungracious brother made no reply; he only
applied again to his little brown box.</p>

<p>“Sir Digby asked me if you would not join his circle,”
continued Isa; “but I told him that you did not yet
venture to expose yourself to the night air. Was I
right? You will, of course, call upon him some morning;
you will find him a pleasant acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“I am not hunting after acquaintances; I’ve neither
health nor spirits for society,” replied Gaspar, rising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
languidly from his chair; “and as for these grandees of
the Castle, I should not find them much in <i>my</i> line,
however much they may be in yours.”</p>

<p>The brother and sister, after a cold “Good-night,”
retired to their several apartments, Isa asking herself as
she ascended the chilly staircase whether it were his
fault or her own that she was disappointed in Gaspar.</p>

<p>She found her little servant Lottie awaiting her in
her room, ready to perform the offices of lady’s-maid, in
which the young rustic took great pride and pleasure.
Lottie Stone was a source of amusement as well as of
interest to Isa; in her simplicity and ignorance she was
so utterly unlike any of her class whom the lady had
met with before. The girl, painfully shy before
strangers, had a naive frankness with her young mistress,
which was almost like the confidence of a child.
Isa by no means discouraged this confidence, which gave
her much influence over the young being placed under
her care. The rustic knew little of manners, and was
once detected in the act of snuffing the candle with her
fingers. Isa in vain tried to teach her to understand
the thermometer by which the valetudinarian regulated
the heat of his room, and seemed to have no idea of the
difference between hot weather and cold. Gaspar used
angrily to declare that Lottie was certain to leave the
window open whenever a sharp east wind was blowing.
In defiance of etiquette, if anything playful were said at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
table, Lottie Stone was certain to laugh; and she would
stand, dish in hand, to listen to a lively anecdote related
by Isa to her brother, quite oblivious of the fact that
the viands were growing cold. Gently and smilingly
Isa corrected the mistakes of the inexperienced Lottie,
and tried to soften down the displeasure of Mr. Gritton,
who was far less disposed to show indulgence. Much
might be excused, she would observe, in a girl so perfectly
honest and truthful: the grain of the wood was
so good, that it was worth taking the trouble to work
it, and the polish would be added in time. Isa encouraged
Lottie to open her heart to her without reserve:
but for this kindly intercourse between mistress and
maid, the life of the young girl would have had little of
brightness, as Hannah, the only other servant, was both
ill-tempered and deaf. “Miss Isa” was all in all to
Lottie, looked up to, beloved and obeyed with affectionate
devotion. Lottie’s happiest time was the half-hour
spent at night with her mistress; for while she brushed
Isa’s long silky tresses, the lady entered into conversation
with her. When Miss Gritton first trusted her
beautiful hair into Lottie’s inexperienced hands, she had
something to suffer as well as to teach; but pains and
patience had their usual effect, and it was only when
the little maid was speaking of something of special
interest that she tried the philosophy of her kind young
mistress.</p>

<p class="caption">ISA AND LOTTIE STONE.</p>
</div>

<p>“So you were at the lecture to-night, Lottie. I hope
that you were attentive to all that the clergyman said.”</p>

<p>“I did try to be so, Miss Isa; there were things as I
couldn’t make out; but Mrs. Bolder and me, we was
talking it over all the way home, and was looking for
the Midianites in the heart.”</p>

<p>“And did you find any?” asked Isa.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bolder, she was a-saying that it’s very hard to
keep out distrust when things go so contrary in life.
She has a deal of trouble, has Mrs. Bolder, now that her
husband’s laid up and crippled with rheumatics, and
she’s all the work of the shop upon her; it’s a’most too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
much for her, she says. She can’t help wondering why
God should send such sickness and pain to her husband,
who was al’ays a good, steady-going man, and a tea-totaller,”—Lottie
uttered the word almost with reverence;
“if he’d been given to drink it would have been
different, you know.”</p>

<p>The saddened tone of Lottie as she uttered the last
sentence reminded Isa of what Mr. Eardley had told her
of the early trials of this more than orphan girl. A
brutal father, addicted to intemperance, had made the
hovel in which Lottie had passed the first years of her
life, a den of poverty and woe. Then this father, unworthy
of the name, had absconded, deserting an unhappy
wife and two children, the elder of whom, a boy,
from physical infirmities and dulness of mind, was yet
more helpless than the poor little girl. Mr. Eardley had
been for years the earthly protector of the family; he
had procured employment for Deborah Stone, had had
her children taught in his school, had, as we know,
found a place for Lottie as soon as she was able to take
one, and had often put such work in the way of her
brother as the poor lad was not incapacitated from performing.</p>

<p>“And did you find the Midianite Distrust in your
own soul also?” asked Isa.</p>

<p>The mournful tone of Lottie changed to a cheerful
one as she made reply, “Oh! as mother says, who’s to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
trust God if we don’t, when He has helped us through
such a many troubles, and given us such kind friends?
Only—just—sometimes,” she added more slowly, “when
I thinks of poor father, then a feeling will come; but I
s’pose it’s wrong—God is so good!” and she sighed.</p>

<p>Isa perceived that the shadow of the poor girl’s great
trial lay on her young heart still.</p>

<p>“You can always pray for your father, Lottie.”</p>

<p>“I do, Miss Isa, I do, morning and evening, and so
does mother; and surely God will hear!” cried the girl,
brightening up at the thought. “He knows where bees
father, though we don’t; and maybe He will bring him
back to us at last.”</p>

<p>There was something touching to Isa in the clinging
affection of the young creature towards a parent whom
she could not honour, and whom she had so little cause
to love.</p>

<p>“And did you find any Discontent lurking within?”
inquired the lady, returning to the point of conversation
from which she had diverged.</p>

<p>“Discontent!” repeated Lottie, opening her black eyes
wide at the question; “O Miss Isa, how could I—with
meat every day, and a whole sovereign every quarter?
That would be ungrateful indeed! Ah! if you knew
how we lived here at Wildwaste when I was little, in
the cottage that’s been pulled down—close by the ‘Jolly
Gardener’ it was, where the school is a-standing now!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
We’ve been half the day—mother, brother, and I—without
breaking a bit of bread; and we might have
been the other half too,” added Lottie, naively, “had
not Mrs. Holdich been so kind, and the tall gentleman
from the Castle, bless him! he brought us nice things
from his own table under his cloak.”</p>

<p>“Do you speak of Mr. Madden?” asked Isa, with a
little tremulousness in her tone.</p>

<p>“Yes; the best, the kindest gentleman as ever lived—barring
Mr. Eardley,” said Lottie, warmly. “He
was al’ays teaching the children good, and looking arter
the poor.”</p>

<p>“Lionel Madden,” murmured Isa, dreamily; it was
the first time for years that that name had passed her
lips.</p>

<p>“Oh no, not he!” exclaimed Lottie, in a tone more
emphatic than her hearer liked, for it conveyed more
distinctly than words that Lionel was one of the last
persons likely to play the philanthropist in the manner
described. “It was not he, but his brother. Mr.
Lionel! he never gave to nobody, nor did nothing for
nobody as ever I heard of; only,” added the girl, with
a little laugh, “he switched my brother over the head
with his riding-whip once, to make him stand out of his
way.”</p>

<p>Isa did not care to keep up the conversation; she
took up an elegantly-bound book which lay on her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
toilette-table, to convey a hint of silence to her little
maid-servant. The volume was a collection of sacred
poetry, and the lady’s eyes rested long and thoughtfully
upon the well-known verse on which their gaze first fell
as she opened the book. It appeared like a comment
on what she had heard that evening on the subject of
Disappointment.</p>

<p>So, whether she acknowledged the fact or not, had

<h3>THE DEATH-BED MESSAGE.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Isa awoke on the following morning with a
feeling of oppression on her heart, a vague
impression that something had been neglected
which ought to have been done, and she connected
that something with the lecture which
she had heard on the preceding day. Several minutes
passed, however, before she could trace back the links of
thought to the actual cause of her uneasiness, as it lay
out of the general course of reflection suggested by the
subject of the lecture. Then Isa recalled the words
which at the time that she heard them had painfully
reminded her of a death-bed scene, perhaps the saddest
recollection left on a mind which had had of late much
experience of sorrow. “The Christian may be called to
draw upon himself the anger of men by defending the
truth, or upholding the cause of the oppressed.”</p>

<p>“It is more than two years,” reflected Isa, “since I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
received a sacred charge from the dying lips of my dear
father; and that charge I have never obeyed. For
more than two years may an orphan have been suffering
wrong on account of my brother, and during all this
time I have let the sin rest on his soul. I first put off
an explanation till I should meet him; then, when we
met, I shrank from doing my duty. I quieted conscience
with every kind of frivolous excuse; he was too
delicate, too sensitive, too busy, it would be better to
delay speaking till we should be alone together in some
peaceful home. We have been alone together, we have
passed hours, days, weeks in each other’s society, with
nothing to hinder me from speaking, except my own
cowardly dislike of saying what might probably offend.
Surely cowardice like this is another Midianite in possession,
and I shall never know real peace till I have
wrestled it down. Whenever the remembrance of that
charge comes over my mind, it is like a cloud darkening
the sunshine, and throwing a chill around. God help
me to fulfil at length a neglected duty! I will speak
to Gaspar before this day has passed over.”</p>

<p>To some strong natures there might have appeared
little that was formidable in the task before her, but to
Isa it was peculiarly painful. Brought up as an only
daughter, tenderly nurtured from her cradle, she had
hardly known what it was to have to encounter even a
grave look or a hasty word,—Isa had never learned to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
<i>endure hardness</i>. Fond of pleasing, both from natural
kindliness of heart and love of approbation, Isa never
willingly gave offence; with her to inflict pain was to
suffer it. Isa delighted in deeds of kindness and works
of beneficence; to comfort the sorrowing, or rejoice with
the happy was congenial to her womanly spirit; but to
restrain, rebuke, oppose—the sterner duties which are
sometimes assigned to the most gentle of the sex in the
battle-field of life—cost Isa an effort which can only be
appreciated by those of a disposition like her own.</p>

<p>Isa’s heart throbbed uneasily with the feeling that the
explanation so long dreaded, so long put off, was at
hand, as she sat in the apartment which she called her
boudoir, but which was always used as a breakfast-room.
The bronze urn was hissing on the table, on which was
spread a somewhat meagre repast. Awaiting her
brother, who was late, Isa placed herself by the window,
and gazed forth on the prospect before her. There was
little to charm in that prospect, even on a bright spring
day. A tract of common spread in front, dotted with
golden patches of blossoming furze; but the picturesqueness
of heath land was marred by the low-lying hamlet
which was the foreground of the landscape. The cottages,
or rather hovels of Wildwaste, wore an appearance
of squalor and decay, which was not softened by the
charm which moss and lichen and clustering ivy can
throw around even ruins. They appeared rather falling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
to pieces because originally ill-built, than because they
were ancient. The only tenement at Wildwaste which
looked in perfect repair, and with some pretension to
beauty, was the neat little school-house, erected by a
Madden, but not, as Isa had soon learned from Lottie,
either by Lionel or by Cora. “How pleasant,” mused
Isa, as she watched the little clusters of cottage children
entering the low-browed porch—“how pleasant to leave
behind such a memorial of a passing visit to a place as
that young Arthur has left!” and as she thought of her
brother, with his ample means yet penurious disposition,
she felt painfully how far better it is to possess the heart
to give than the money.</p>

<p>The soap manufactory, lying a little to the right of
the prospect, a huge unsightly square-windowed pile of
brick and mortar, was a yet more conspicuous object
than the hamlet of Wildwaste. It stood not two hundred
yards from Isa’s home, so that when the wind blew
from that quarter she dared not open the windows to let
in the breezes, so polluted were they by smoke and evil
scent. The only redeeming feature in the landscape
seen from the lodge was the park which skirted the road
beyond the common, the beautiful park above whose
light leafy screen rose the gray turrets of Castle
Lestrange. There, indeed, beauty and peace might
dwell; thence no ruder sound would be heard than the
cuckoo’s note or the nightingale’s song. Isa’s eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
overlooking nearer and less pleasing objects, constantly
wandered to those verdant woods, those lofty picturesque
towers.</p>

<p>Gaspar entered the sitting-room with a complaint on
his lips against “treacherous weather” on that clear
April morn, for he was never weary of contrasting the
climate of England with that of Jamaica, much to the
disadvantage of the former, though the heat of the latter
seemed to have dried up and withered his frame. He
seated himself at the table, and began cutting the stale
loaf (bread at the lodge was always stale), but interrupted
himself with the observation, “How one misses
the papers of a morning! Isa, I wish you’d ask your
uncle, the baronet, to send over the <i>Times</i> every day.”</p>

<p>“I should hardly like to ask that favour,” replied Isa,
leaving the window, and joining her brother at the
breakfast-table.</p>

<p>“And why not?” inquired Gaspar peevishly; “are
you afraid of robbing the servant’s hall?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Isa, as she occupied herself with the tea-caddy;
“but my uncle would naturally think that we
might take in a paper for ourselves, instead of putting
him to the inconvenience of sending a mile every
morning.”</p>

<p>“I’m not the idiot to throw away my money on what
may be had for the asking; you have so much foolish
pride,” muttered Mr. Gritton. “I feel myself out of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
world where I can’t get a glimpse of the money-market
or the shipping report.”</p>

<p>That word “shipping” served as a cue to Isa. While
sitting by the window she had been revolving in her
mind how she should introduce the subject of her father’s
dying message to Gaspar. Isa was convinced that her
long silence had been sinful, and having “screwed up
her courage to the sticking point,” was on the watch for
an opportunity of saying what she had determined should
be said. Too anxious to make some commencement to
be able to do so without the appearance of effort, Isa
abruptly remarked, in a tone that betrayed a little nervousness,
“Is not your interest in the shipping chiefly
on account of the <i>Orissa</i>?”</p>

<p>“The <i>Orissa</i>?” repeated Mr. Gritton in accents of surprise;
“why, all the world knows that she foundered
nigh four years ago, passengers saved, cargo lost, and the
greater part uninsured.”</p>

<p>“Had you anything to do with the vessel?” asked
Isa, timidly feeling her way.</p>

<p>Gaspar looked a little embarrassed by the question.
“Yes—no,” he replied, almost with a stammer. “I
might have had a stake in that vessel—I thought of
having—’twas lucky I had not; there had been such a
run for certain goods in the West Indian market, that
the cargo was expected to bring double its value. But—but
you know nothing and care nothing about matters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
of business,” he added, stretching out his hand for
the cup of tea which his sister had poured out. “Has
the post brought any letters this morning?”</p>

<p>Isa did not suffer the current of conversation to be
thus abruptly turned. Merely shaking her head in reply
to the question, she nerved herself to go one step further.
“Who was the orphan whose property was in
some way or other connected with the <i>Orissa</i>?”</p>

<p>“Orphan! what do you mean? Who on earth talked
to you about an orphan?” Isa felt—for she dared not
look up—that her brother’s eyes were keenly scrutinising
her face.</p>

<p>“Better have the whole truth out at once,” thought
poor Isa, who, in her nervousness, was emptying the
milk-jug into the tea-pot. “The fact is, dear Gaspar,”
she said, speaking with rapidity and a sensation of
breathlessness, “I have been anxious for a long time to
talk to you about some words uttered by our beloved
father a very, very short time before we lost him. When
he was almost too ill to speak, he said”—Isa pressed her
forehead as if to collect her thoughts—“he said, ‘Gaspar—you
will be with him—the <i>Orissa</i>—not her money
lost—tell him from me;’ the dear lips had not power to
finish the sentence.”</p>

<p>“Did my father say anything more than these
words?” asked Gaspar, who saw from the quivering of
Isa’s lashes and the trembling of her lip that she at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
least attached some importance to the fragmentary
message.</p>

<p>Isa pressed her hands very tightly together; she
could hardly articulate the broken sentences—“He said,
‘<i>something wrong</i>—he should deal fairly by that orphan’—I
can remember no more.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus7.jpg" width="500" height="575" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE CONVERSATION AT BREAKFAST.</p>
</div>

<p>Gaspar rose abruptly from his seat and walked to the
window. Isa felt the brief silence which followed almost
unendurable, and yet was thankful that she had been
enabled to speak out the whole truth at last. After a
few seconds Gaspar returned to his seat, and with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
rapid—Isa fancied a slightly tremulous utterance—thus
addressed his sister:—</p>

<p>“Isa, your ears deceived you—your memory is at
fault—or—or there was a wandering of mind at the last.
You shall know exactly how the case lies. A young
lady, known to my father and myself, had some thousands
of pounds which she wished to invest, four years
ago, during my short visit to England. My father was
consulted on the business. There was a sudden demand for
a particular kind of goods in the West Indies; money invested
in them might double itself if no time were lost; the
girl was eager to increase her property—natural enough,—I
was employed in making the arrangement—ship
went down—goods uninsured—she had staked her property,
and lost it. This was no fault of mine; you
might blame the captain or the crew, or the winds and
the waves; I was never blamed by Cora Madden herself.”</p>

<p>“Cora Madden!” ejaculated Isa.</p>

<p>“You know the whole truth now,” said Gaspar; “let
us never come on the subject again.”</p>

<p>Isa felt bewildered by the sudden disclosure of the
name of the orphan in whom she had taken such painful
interest; so much so, that she could hardly tell at that
time whether the explanation of Gaspar were satisfactory
or not to her mind. When the name of Cora was
uttered, Isa’s surprise had made her for a moment look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
full in the face of her brother, and that face—which had
been almost ghastly—had become suffused with a colour
which she had never before seen upon it, and the eyes
of Gaspar had instantly sunk beneath the gaze of her
own. Isa hardly noticed this in the excitement of the
instant, but it afterwards often recurred to her mind,
with an ever-strengthening persuasion that her brother
had <i>not</i> told her all.</p>

<p>The subject of the death-bed message was dropped,
but Isa felt during the remainder of that morning that
her brother’s nerves had been shaken, and that his spirits
were utterly out of tune; and she could not but refer
this to its natural cause—the conversation at breakfast.
Nothing pleased Mr. Gritton: the tea was bitter, cold,
undrinkable; the room full of draughts; Lottie a useless
idiot, and Mr. Eardley little better for having ever recommended
her. Isa came in for her full share of
peevish reproach, almost more difficult to be borne than
angry rebuke. It was a great relief to the young lady
when her companion at length quitted her boudoir to go
down to his accounts, though Isa well knew that these
accounts would afford a new cause of grievance, and that
all her care to manage household affairs with strict
economy would not prevent pettish remarks on the
extravagance of the Saturday bills.</p>

<p>“I shall not be able to endure this kind of life long,”
murmured Isa to herself, as she returned from ordering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
dinner, having had to encounter the ill-temper of Hannah,
who, while her master inveighed against reckless extravagance,
complained on the other hand that there were
“some ladies as think that their servants can live upon
nothing.” “I was never made to bear all this constant
fret and worry,” sighed the discouraged Isa; “this perpetual
effort to please, without the possibility of succeeding
in doing so.” Isa was, like so many others, tempted
to think that the post in which Providence had placed
her was not the one that suited her; that she would <i>do</i>
better, <i>be</i> better in another. Disappointment, discontent,
distrust, had not been driven forth from her heart.
Again Isa seated herself by the window which commanded
a view of the towers of Lestrange, feeling disinclined
to settle to any occupation, to take up her work,
or to finish her book.</p>

<p>A visit from Edith made a delightful break on the
dreary solitude of Isa.</p>

<p>“I have come with a message from papa, dear Isa,”
cried the baronet’s daughter, after an affectionate greeting
had passed between the cousins; “he has charged me
to carry you back captive with me to the Castle, to
remain there as long as we can make our prisoner happy.
Oh, don’t make resistance—lay down your arms and
surrender at once!” The pleading eyes seconded well
the playful petition of the lips.</p>

<p>A prisoner! nay, to Isa the invitation came like an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
offer of freedom to one in irksome bondage. Her countenance
lighted up with pleasure. “I should gladly
surrender to so generous a foe,” she replied, “only—my
brother—”</p>

<p>“He will let me carry you off, I am sure that he
will,” cried Edith.</p>

<p>“I will go and ask him,” said Isa, hastily rising and
quitting the room.</p>

<p>Edith, left thus alone, looked around the boudoir of
her cousin with mingled pity and surprise. “Poor Isa,
is this her abode? so small, so wretchedly furnished, so
dreary and bare. And what a view from the window!”
added the heiress, as she sauntered up to the casement;
“the very look of those tumble-down cottages would
make one miserable; and as for that hideous manufactory,
it would spoil the fairest landscape in the world.
No wonder that Isa was not able to echo my words
when I said, ‘There is no place like home.’”</p>

<p>Isa soon returned with her brother’s permission for
her to accompany her cousin, a permission which he
could hardly have withheld. Edith knew not how ungraciously
it had been accorded, how bitterly Gaspar
had remarked, “I knew that you would never care to
stay quietly here with an invalid brother.”</p>

<p>“Had he been like a brother to me,” was Isa’s mental
comment when she quitted the room, “no pleasure would
have drawn me from his side.” Nevertheless Mr. Gritton’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
observation gave pain to his sister, and so did the
distressed look on the face of Lottie, when hastily summoned
to help her young mistress in her preparations
for quitting the Lodge.</p>

<p>“O Miss Isa, I hope you’ll not be long away; we’ll
be just lost without you;” and Isa saw that moisture
rose in Lottie’s black eyes.</p>

<p>Isa returned with Edith to the Castle, where she was
graciously received by her stately uncle. Two beautiful
rooms, exquisitely furnished, one opening into the other,
had been assigned to her; none in the Castle commanded
a more beautiful prospect. Swiftly the hours rolled by
amidst varied occupations. Cheerful was the afternoon
saunter in the park with Edith, and the little dinner-party
in the evening, when Isa met with congenial
society. Pleasant on the following morning was the
drive to the distant church, and very refreshing to the
spirit the sacred service, conducted with none of the
lifeless formality which cast such a chill over Isa’s devotion
in the church which she had attended with Gaspar.
Delightful was the evening converse with Edith; converse
on high and holy themes. Then, on the Monday
morning, Isa much enjoyed visiting with her sweet
young cousin some of the dwellings of Sir Digby’s
poorer tenants, bearing little delicacies to invalids from
the baronet’s luxurious table. All these employments
were in themselves innocent and good, and to Isa would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
have afforded unmixed gratification, but for a feeling
which would intrude itself on her mind, that she was
where she liked to be rather than where she ought to
be—that even her holiest pleasures were rather of her
own taking than of God’s bestowing. Whenever Gaspar
or Wildwaste were mentioned, a slightly uncomfortable
sensation was experienced by Isa. Well she knew that
her presence was more needed in the dreary Lodge than
in the stately Castle; more by the peevish invalid than
by the happy young girl; a brother, an only brother,
had a stronger claim on her care than a cousin. Isa
suspected, though she cared not to search for confirmation
of the suspicion, that Self-indulgence was another
Midianite in possession of her soul.</p>

<p>So passed the time till Tuesday brought the little
meeting in the cottage of Holdich, which the cousins
attended. The first face which Isa caught sight of on
entering the crowded room was that of her maid, Lottie
Stone, beaming with an expression of honest pleasure at
seeing her mistress again. Isa and Edith were a little
late in joining the meeting, the former had therefore no
opportunity of speaking to Lottie till the lecture and
prayers were over.</p>

<h3>LECTURE II.—FAITH IN THE PROMISE.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">We left Gideon at his lowly task, threshing corn
by the wine-press to bide it from the Midianites.
The Israelite lifted up his eyes, and,
behold, One stood before him, clothed in
human form, and yet nor man nor angel;
for from the words which He afterwards uttered, such
as no created being dare have breathed, we recognize in
Him the eternal Son of God. As the Lord appeared
to Abraham in the plains of Mamre, to Jacob by the
ford of Jabbok, to Moses on the height of Sinai, so appeared
He now to Gideon beneath the oak-tree of
Ophrah. Unconscious of the divinity of his Guest,
Gideon still appears to have received with reverence
the greeting of the mysterious stranger, as though
aware that He came as a messenger from the Most
High.</p>

<p>“The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
was the salutation of the Holy One to the son of a despised
and persecuted race.</p>

<p>“Oh my Lord,” exclaimed Gideon, “if the Lord be
with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be
all the miracles which our fathers told of, saying, Did
not the Lord bring us up from Egypt? But now the
Lord hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hand
of the Midianites.”</p>

<p>How often must such thoughts have passed through
the mind of Gideon before they thus found vent in
words. Faith, sorely tried by present trouble, was trying
to draw from memories of the past hope for the
future. God, who had crushed the pride of Pharaoh,
and led His people forth from Egyptian bondage, would
He not now save and avenge? There had been miracles
of old; such mercies as had been experienced by the
fathers, might they not also be reserved for the children?
Was the Lord’s arm shortened that it could not save;
was He unmindful of the groans of His people? Oh,
why had He forsaken Israel, and given His heritage
unto reproach?</p>

<p>“And the Lord looked upon Gideon, and said, Go in
this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand
of the Midianites: have I not sent thee?”</p>

<p>Let us dwell for a few moments on the words, <i>The
Lord looked upon Gideon</i>. Thrice in the Scriptures do
we read of a look from Him who beholdeth all things in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
heaven and earth. In one sense the omniscient God is
for ever gazing down upon His creation; from Him
ocean depths are no hiding-place, and midnight darkness
no screen. The eyes of the Lord are in every place,
beholding the evil and the good. But on some special
occasions God’s glance has in a peculiar way been
directed upon man, as the sunbeams that shine on all
may be concentrated in the focus of a burning-glass to
kindle or to destroy. The Lord <i>looked</i> from the pillar
of cloud upon the Egyptians, and they were troubled—they
felt God’s wrath in that gaze; the Lord <i>looked</i>
upon Gideon, and in that glance was new courage and
strength; the Lord <i>looked</i> upon Peter, and beneath that
gaze of divine compassion and love his heart was broken
and melted, and fast flowed his penitential tears. Have
we ever known the power of that look in our hearts, to
crush our sins, to encourage our faith, to bring us in
deep contrition to the feet of our merciful Lord?</p>

<p>Gideon, like Moses before him, seems to have shrunk
from the post of high honour to which he was called by
God; like Moses, he thought of his own unfitness instead
of the almighty power of Him who can employ—and
often does employ—feeble instruments to accomplish the
most noble and difficult works. “Oh my Lord,” he
cried, “wherewith shall I save Israel? Behold, my
family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my
father’s house.” Before honour is humility; had Gideon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
been great or wise in his own eyes, we may well believe
that God would have passed him by, to choose one of a
lowlier spirit to be the leader of Israel’s hosts.</p>

<p>“Surely I will be with thee,” said the Lord, “and
thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.”</p>

<p>Still Gideon appears to have hesitated; perhaps a
doubt lingered on his mind as to the nature of Him who
spake as having authority, but who as yet had wrought
no miracle to prove his divine commission. “If now I
have found grace in Thy sight,” said Gideon, “then show
me a sign that Thou talkest with me. Depart not hence,
I pray Thee, until I come unto Thee, and bring forth my
present, and set it before Thee.” And the Holy One
said, “I will tarry till thou come again.”</p>

<p>Then—like his father Abraham, glad to entertain the
heavenly Guest—Gideon made ready a feast. He prepared
a kid, and unleavened cakes, and brought them
forth to the Lord, who had graciously awaited his return
under the oak of Ophrah—a spot which became as a
temple consecrated by His divine presence.</p>

<p>The Holy One bade Gideon lay the food on the rock,
and pour out the broth. What man designed for a feast,
God would receive as a sacrifice. With the end of the
staff which was in His hand the sacred Guest touched
the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and the stone on
which they lay became as an altar. Fire arose from the
rock and consumed the offering of Gideon, and the divine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
Being—who had thus accepted as God what was presented
to Him as man—vanished out of the sight of His
servant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus8.jpg" width="500" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE SACRIFICE.</p>
</div>

<p>The first emotion of the astonished Gideon seems to
have been that of terror. “Alas! O Lord God,” he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
exclaimed, “because I have seen an angel of the Lord
face to face.”</p>

<p>A gracious promise of love came in answer to that cry
of fear; we know not whether the divine voice sounded
in the mortal’s ear, or but spoke with mysterious power
in his soul. The Lord said unto Gideon, “Peace be unto
thee, fear not; thou shalt not die.”</p>

<p>Then, in that holy spot where the Lord had deigned
to appear in human guise, Gideon built an altar, and
called it <i>Jehovah shallum</i>, which is, <i>The Lord send peace</i>.</p>

<p>And now, beloved friends, let us apply to our hearts
the lessons contained in this portion of the history of
Gideon. Hath not the Lord appeared unto us with a
promise of help and deliverance, if we in His might will
struggle against the enemies within? He comes to us not
only in the house of prayer, not only in seasons of holy
communion, but when we, like Gideon, are following the
common occupations of life. His eye is fixed upon us in
tender compassion, and His message to the lowly Christian
entering on the battle-field of life is this: <i>Go in
this thy might: have I not sent thee? I will be with
thee.</i></p>

<p>Let us glean from the Scriptures some promises of this
blessing of the Lord’s peculiar presence with His people.
To those obeying His command to preach the gospel
amongst all nations, how precious through centuries of
toil and peril has been the gracious assurance: <i>Lo, I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
with you alway, even unto the end of the world</i>. To
those almost sinking under the heavy trials of life, how
full of comfort is the promise: <i>Fear thou not; for I am
with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God. I will
strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold
thee with the right hand of My righteousness.</i>
Through life, even unto the grave, the power of that
promise extends, so that the Christian can add in lowly
trust: <i>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with
me</i>.</p>

<p>But who are they who can thus take to themselves
the precious promises of Christ? They who have come
to Him in lowly faith; or rather, they to whom the
Lord hath come in the power of redeeming love. In the
history of Gideon we see a type of the Lord’s dealings
with His people. He is found of them that sought Him
not; He comes to the sorrowful, the oppressed, the
tempted, and offers to them the free deliverance which
His mercy alone can bestow. We have nothing to give
the sacred Guest but the offering of a sin-stained heart,
a heart wholly unworthy of His acceptance, <i>till He touch
it</i>, as He touched the offering of Gideon, and the flame
of divine love is kindled, and the sacrifice of a broken
and contrite heart becomes acceptable unto the Lord.
Then, like Gideon, may we raise our altar with grateful
thanksgiving; and, while preparing for the struggle with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
indwelling sin, feel assured that the Lord will “send
peace.”</p>

<p>We are also reminded, by this transient visit of the
Son of God to the world, of His longer sojourn with the
children of Israel, when for more than thirty-three years
the Redeemer waited on earth till the bitter cup should
be filled to the brim—till the great Sacrifice should be
offered—and then ascended to His Father in heaven,
thereby granting additional proof of His divinity to His
adoring people. “The Lord send peace,” was the name
given by Gideon to his altar, and our Lord’s words on
the night before His crucifixion sound like a response to
that name: <i>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give
unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.
Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</i></p>

<p>But what is the promised peace? To Gideon his
heavenly Visitor had spoken of conflict: “Go in this thy
might; thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.” In
this command to Gideon, my brethren, we hear our
Master’s charge to ourselves, and learn what it is that can
give us strength to obey that charge. The Christian is
promised peace, but it is such as may be realized to some
degree even in the midst of conflict; and it is that peace
which, after conflict, in its perfection crowneth victory.</p>

<p>The Midianites within must be conquered, and the
might which conquers is from God. If disappointment
blight our hopes, discontent fret our spirits, dissension<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
mar our peace, distrust shrink from expected trials, we
must yet lift up our eyes unto the hills from whence
cometh our help—we must yet ask, and we shall receive,
the grace which can supply all our need, and enable us
to rise above the infirmities of the flesh, the weakness of
our fallen nature. Let us trust fearlessly, let us trust
alone in the might of our Lord. As long as we remain
in presumptuous self-confidence, the Midianites rest in
possession; when we cast ourselves in earnest prayer at
the feet of the Saviour, He maketh us <i>more than conquerors</i>.</p>

<p>We contemplated Faith, when last we met here, as
the tree which in winter stands bare of foliage, black and
leafless, yet with life within it. With Gideon now that
tree had felt the warm breath of spring—the Lord had
looked upon it, and the living sap had risen under the
beams of the Sun of Righteousness; the green leaves of
hope were budding on the boughs. Gideon had not as
yet conquered his foes, but the Lord had promised that
he should do so, and the expectation of triumph was
before him.</p>

<p>Christian brethren, let us also rejoice in help, and so
gird ourselves up for the struggle before us, taking as
the motto on our banner, <i>Go in this thy might</i>, and as
the cordial to our weak fainting hearts the promise, <i>I
will be with thee</i>.</p>

<h3>A SERMON BY THE FIRESIDE.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Isa stopped to speak a few words to Lottie after
the short service was ended.</p>

<p>“O Miss Isa, I do hope you won’t be away
long,” cried the young girl, looking up into the
face of her mistress with a pleading expression;
“we do miss you so sadly!”</p>

<p>“Is my brother better?” asked Isa.</p>

<p>“Master shuts himself up a deal in his room, and don’t
care to be disturbed, and seems worried like—he do,”
replied Lottie with rustic simplicity, and in a tone from
which Isa too readily gathered that neither Gaspar’s
spirits nor his temper had improved since her departure.
“O Miss Isa, I wish you’d come back!”</p>

<p>“Tell my brother that, without fail, I’ll come and see
him to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“And stay with him?” asked Lottie, anxiously.</p>

<p>Isa hesitated for a moment, but she could not bring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
herself to say “Yes.” There was to be on the following
evening another of those delightful little parties at the
Castle, at which Isa anticipated that she would enjoy one
of the sweetest and purest of pleasures, that of converse
with the intellectual, the refined, and the good—converse
that gratifies at once the mind and the heart. Isa was
little disposed to exchange such pleasure for a dull,
cheerless evening at the Lodge, spent beside a peevish
valetudinarian, who would neither appreciate nor thank
her for the sacrifice. No; she would make a compromise
with conscience; she would give the morning to her
brother, and doubly enjoy the evening from the consciousness
of having performed an irksome duty. Isa sent by
Lottie a message to her brother, and then, only half
satisfied with herself, returned with Edith to the Castle.</p>

<p>Lottie walked silently for a little time beside Mrs.
Bolder, the grocer’s wife, who was always the young girl’s
companion to and from the evening meeting. Lottie
broke the silence by a sigh.</p>

<p>“Oh, but the house has grown dull and lonesome!”
she murmured. “Half of the pleasure of going to the
lecture was to talk it over after, and have the hard things
explained.”</p>

<p>“You don’t find old Hannah much of a companion, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“Hannah!” repeated Lottie dolefully; “she never
speaks to me but to chide; nor does master, for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
matter of that. Oh, how I does miss dear mother and
brother! there’s no one near me as cares for me, now
that Miss Isa’s away. I’m afeard that the Midianite
Discontent is creeping in after all.” Poor Lottie, with
her warm, impulsive, affectionate nature, found even the
“meat every day, and a sovereign a quarter,” insufficient
to brighten her solitary lot.</p>

<p>“We ought to have learned this evening how to get
rid of the Midianite,” observed quiet Mrs. Bolder, but in
a melancholy tone, for she herself was oppressed with
cares, and had by nature little spirit to struggle against
them.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lottie more cheerfully; “<i>I will be with
thee</i>, that is a wonderful word! I will repeat it over and
over to myself, when I lie down, and when I get up, and
when I’m about my work. We should never feel lonesome
or sad when the dear Lord says, <i>I will be with
thee</i>: with us all through our lives; and then when the
time comes for us to die, we know that we shall be <i>with
Him</i>.”</p>

<p>The same promise which strengthened a warrior of old
for heroic deeds, cheered and encouraged a little servant
maid in her path of humble toil. Lottie trod more lightly
on her way when she thought of Gideon and his heavenly
Guest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bolder, after she had parted from Lottie, turned
towards the single shop in the hamlet of Wildwaste,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
which was kept by herself and her husband. The shutters
were up, so she saw no light, but the door was upon the
latch, and she entered through the shop into the little
back-parlour where Tychicus Bolder, seated by the fire,
was awaiting his wife’s return from the meeting.</p>

<p>Sadly poor Miriam looked on what she called “the
wreck of such a fine man!” Over the hard-featured,
smoke-dried looking face of Bolder, wrinkled with many
a line traced by care and pain, hung the white hair,
streaked here and there with iron gray. His beard had
grown long, and lay on his sunken chest; his back was
bowed, his knees drawn up, as he sat with his feet on the
fender, with a black shawl of his wife’s wrapped round his
rheumatic frame. Bolder could not turn his head without
pain; but he bade his wife shut the door, come and sit
beside him, and tell him all about the parson’s lecture.</p>

<p>“Oh, how different it was in the days when it was
you that went, and you that had the telling—you who
can talk like a parson yourself!” sighed Mrs. Bolder, as
she stirred the fire, which was getting low, as Bolder
had no power to stir it himself.</p>

<p>“Wife,” said Bolder solemnly, “you’ve been to a
lecture, and I dare say a good one, for I think more of
Mr. Eardley now than I did in old times; but I’ve had
my sermon too, as I sat here by the fire, and my preacher
was one as spoke with more power than Mr. Eardley, or
any other parson under the sun!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus9.jpg" width="500" height="425" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MR. AND MRS. BOLDER.</p>
</div>

<p>“Why, who can have been here?” exclaimed Mrs.
Bolder, glancing towards the door.</p>

<p>“Sit down, wife, and I’ll tell you all,” said Tychicus
Bolder. “When you had gone out, and I was left alone
with my pain—”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I’d gladly have stayed with you,” interrupted
Miriam; “I went because you told me to go.”</p>

<p>“I know it—I know it—I sent you. Well, as I sat
here alone with my pain, I began turning over in my
mind what you’d told me of the last lecture, of the
Midianites in possession. Ay, thinks I, I have them all
here, every one of the four. There’s Disappointment;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
for wasn’t I a thriving man, and looking to get up higher
and higher in the world—leave this place and take a
larger business in Axe—till this sickness came, and pulled
me back, and made it hard enough to struggle on here!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bolder mournfully shook her head.</p>

<p>“And isn’t there Discontent; for it has often seemed
as if the pain, and the weakness, and the helplessness
were a’most more than man could bear!”</p>

<p>“I’m sure that no man could bear them more—”
Miriam stopped in the midst of her sentence, less from a
doubt as to its perfect truth than because she saw that her
husband did not wish to be interrupted; so she relapsed
into her usual position—that of a listener.</p>

<p>“There’s Dissension, for I feel ready to quarrel with
all the world; and Distrust, for I can’t bring myself to
think that I’ve not been hardly dealt with. Now if, as
the parson said, all these enemies are most like to come,
like the Midianites, to a soul where there’s been an idol
set up, where was the idol in mine? You see, wife,
pain and loneliness set an old man thinking.”</p>

<p>“You never had an idol,” said the wife; “in the
midst of such a drunken, disorderly, quarrelsome set as
we have here in Wildwaste, you took the pledge, and
kept it too—never a drop of the poison wetted your
lips; there’s not many a man would have kept steady,
standing all alone as you did. And then you didn’t
worship Mammon; no man can say of you that your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
money was not honestly earned—every penny that you
took in.”</p>

<p>“Bating a few overcharges,” muttered Bolder; “on
the whole, I did keep my hands pretty clean.”</p>

<p>“And you was so religious, too; knew your Bible so
well, could have done for a preacher yourself. If a
parson made a mistake, or wasn’t quite sound in the
doctrine, you was the man who could set him right; you
was such a judge of a sermon!”</p>

<p>“I thought myself so,” said Bolder.</p>

<p>“I can’t make out the reason why God sends you all
these troubles,” pursued the admiring wife, “unless it be
as He let them come to Job, ’cause he was better than
any one else, and God wanted to try his patience.”</p>

<p>“Now, wife, it’s all very well that you should think
this,” said Bolder, in his peculiar tone of decision, “I
was ready enough to think it myself; but when I came
this evening to turn the matter over as I sat here alone,
I could not look at things just in the same light as before.
I found this soul of mine all full of what the parson calls
Midianites; I had not noticed one of ’em when I was in
health and prosperity, but when troubles came, then came
they, like the birds of prey round a sick sheep as it lies
in the field. Then I set to thinking what idol I could
have set up when all things seemed going well with me;—no,
don’t interrupt me, Miriam—I was certain there
had been something wrong. And then an old anecdote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
came into my mind, which I’d heard many years back,
but which I’d never really understood—I mean with my
heart, not my head. It was about a young parson who
was talking on religion to an old pious ploughman as they
walked together in a field. Says the parson, ‘The
hardest thing is to deny sinful self.’ ‘Nay, sir,’ said the
ploughman, ‘the hardest thing, I take it, is to deny <i>righteous</i>
self.’ Why, here, thinks I, is the key to the whole
matter. Here have I been living in Wildwaste, counting
myself an example to all the people around, thanking
God, like the Pharisee, that I was a deal better than
other men, sitting in judgment even at church, setting
up a great idol of self. And so God has let the enemies
come in, just to show me that I am not the saint that I
took myself for, just to set me crying to Him for help,
to bring me to say, what else I had never said, <i>I abhor
myself, and repent in dust and ashes</i>.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bolder, who had been accustomed to look up to
her husband as a kind of infallible pope in his home, one
whose wisdom should never be doubted, whose opinions
should never be disputed, could not at once alter her
long-cherished ideas, but only ventured to express dissent
by a little mournful shake of the head.</p>

<p>“I was always ready enough to judge others,” continued
Bolder, “but it was a new thing for me to judge
myself. I was quick enough to see God’s justice in
punishing other men, but when the rod came upon myself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
then his dealings seemed hard. I could almost
exult when the publican’s house was burned and he
ruined, or when the poor guilty wretch was smothered in
the bog;—that was righteous vengeance, said I. But
when my own comfort was touched, when trouble came
to my home, I could neither see mercy nor justice, and
fierce, rebellious, unbelieving thoughts swept, like the
Midianites, right over my soul.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bolder,” said the anxious wife (she never ventured
to address him by his Christian name), “I shall never
like to leave you so long again, for I’m sure and certain
that being alone is bad for your spirits.”</p>

<p>“Wife, I was no more alone than Gideon was when
the angel came to him under the oak. I told you that
a powerful preacher had been here, and I told you nought
but the truth. The Lord has been preaching to this
proud heart; and if you wish to know the text, it was
this, <i>Unless ye be converted, and become as little children,
ye shall in no wise enter the kingdom of heaven</i>. There
be many mansions there, but not one for the self-righteous
Pharisee. I had thought myself a long way on the road
to heaven, and I found I’d to go back every step of the
way, and begin at the beginning. If it had not been
for what God has shown me, through sickness and trouble,
of the evil lurking in my heart, I might have gone on
blind and self-confident to the last, and never have had my
eyes opened at all—till the terrible Day of Judgment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>It is doubtful whether Tychicus Bolder’s words convinced
his wife, but at least they silenced her, and she
could feel that the change which had passed over the
proud, opinionative man was a change for the better; he
was more patient and resigned under suffering, and far
less disposed to pass a sweeping sentence of condemnation
on all his neighbours in Wildwaste. When Bolder began
to judge himself, he became less ready to judge others;
humility and charity are twin-sisters, and constantly
walk hand-in-hand. Tychicus himself regarded that evening
of quiet heart-searching as a crisis in his life; the
Lord had visited his soul, and had left a blessing and a
promise behind.</p>

<p>And is not this the history of many a human heart?
The great enemy, ever on the watch to destroy, forms
temptations of the very virtues of men, leading them, as
it were, to make a raft of their own honesty, temperance,
respectability, alms-giving, so that, trusting on that to
stem the flood, they may not seek refuge in the only Ark
that can bear them to a heavenly shore. The Almighty,
on the other hand, making <i>all</i> things to work together
for the good of His people, even their very failures and
imperfections, shows them the hollowness and rottenness
of all on which they rested, that they may not trust
their soul’s safety to anything but the merits and mercies
of Christ. Praise, even from the lips of his heavenly
Master, seems to have led St. Peter into presumption, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
that the <i>Blessed art thou</i> had soon to be followed by the
<i>Get thee behind me, Satan</i>; while through the guilt of a
three-fold denial the apostle was led, by God’s grace, to
earnest repentance, distrust of himself, and more fervent
love to his pardoning Lord. Thus God still enables a
David to slay Goliath with his own sword. But for the
visitation of the Midianites, grievous and evil as it was
in itself, Gideon would perhaps never have been blessed
with the visit of the angel of the Lord.</p>

<h3>THE SISTER’S VISIT.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Isa did not fail to keep her promise. Finding
that Mrs. Holdich was about to visit Wildwaste
on the following morning, Isa availed
herself of her escort; for the people of the
hamlet were so rough, that the young lady
disliked crossing the common alone. Rebekah Holdich
carried with her a remedy for rheumatism, which she
hoped might relieve the sufferings of Bolder. The steward’s
wife was the general doctress of the neighbourhood;
to her, as to their natural friend, came all who
had sorrow or sickness in their homes, just as any
labourer in difficulty or distress was sure to seek the
advice and help of her husband.</p>

<p>Isa Gritton entered into conversation with Rebekah,
who was a woman of education and refinement beyond
what might be expected from one in her station of life.</p>

<p>“I find,” observed Isa, “that you were the first friend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
of my little maid Lottie, that it was you who taught her
to read, and first led her to think of her soul, or rather
to know that she had such a thing as a soul.”</p>

<p>“I was very sorry for the poor little child; she had
a most wretched home,” replied Mrs. Holdich.</p>

<p>“Is it true that her father was of such a very violent
temper?”</p>

<p>“So violent when he had been drinking,” said Rebekah,
“that I have seen the poor child disfigured for
weeks from blows received from her father; and as for
her unhappy mother, there is not a doubt that she would
have been actually killed by Abner Stone in one of his
drunken fits, had not Mr. Madden nobly saved her life
at the peril of his own. The ruffian was going to dash
out her brains with a poker.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Lionel came forward——”</p>

<p>“Oh, not Mr. Lionel,” said Mrs. Holdich with a smile;
“I am not aware that he ever entered a cottage; it was
his younger brother, who is now labouring for God in the
Holy Land, he who built the pretty school-house at Wildwaste,
who saved poor Deborah’s life. The beautiful
carvings from Bethlehem which you saw in our cottage
were sent to me by him.”</p>

<p>“What has become of Lottie’s father?” asked Isa,
after having walked on for some minutes in silence.</p>

<p>“No one knows,” replied Rebekah. “Abner Stone
suddenly disappeared from this part of the country, after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
a gentleman had been found lying on the road, having
been knocked off his horse by a highwayman. It is
more than suspected that Stone did the deed, but fled on
hearing some one come up to the spot.”</p>

<p>“It is strange,” observed Isa, “that Lottie could speak
with tenderness of such a parent; her eyes filled with
tears when she expressed her hopes that God would one
day bring him back.”</p>

<p>“Her mother will never hear a word spoken against
him,” said Rebekah. “Poor Deborah Stone is a true,
faithful wife, and I believe prays night and day for the
return of a husband whom she has loved through such
trials as few but herself could have borne. I cannot
help thinking,” pursued the steward’s gentle wife, “that
there must have been some good even in Abner when he
was sober; it is the fatal habit of drinking which makes
a savage even of a kind-hearted man.”</p>

<p>“Lottie was looking sad yesterday evening at the
lecture,” observed Isa.</p>

<p>“Maybe the poor child frets after her mother and
brother,—they were never separated before; they have
clung together through sorrow and hardship, and Lottie
may feel lonely at first away from her home, though it is
but a poor one.”</p>

<p>“It is not easy to arrange for the family to meet,”
said Isa. “Mrs. Stone has to earn her own living, and
Axe is at least six miles from Wildwaste.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>“I hope that you will not mind my mentioning it,
Miss Gritton,” said Rebekah, in a deferential tone, “but
our little open cart is going on Saturday to Axe to bring
our Ned to pass the Sunday with us,”—Mrs. Holdich’s
eye brightened as she spoke of the expected visit from
her son—“and if Lottie could be spared, I am sure that
she would be most welcome to a place in it, to go and
see her poor mother.”</p>

<p>“A good and kind thought,” replied Isa. “She might
stay over Sunday at Axe, and return in the baker’s cart
on the following morning.”</p>

<p>“If you could kindly spare her,” repeated Mrs. Holdich,
almost as much pleased at the prospect of the lonely
Deborah having the comfort of a visit from her child, as
in the expectation of welcoming her own.</p>

<p>“Leave of absence will be easily given,” observed Isa,
“especially as I am not living at Wildwaste at present;
so the services of our little maid are less required, as she
was engaged upon my account.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Holdich turned towards the shop of Bolder,
after accompanying Miss Gritton to the door of the
new brick tenement, which appeared to Isa yet more
bare and destitute either of beauty or comfort every
time that she returned from the wood-girdled Castle of
Lestrange.</p>

<p>Lottie was waiting at the open door to receive her
mistress, having been eagerly on the watch for her return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>“Would you like to go home to your mother, Lottie?”
said Isa.</p>

<p>Instead of the sparkle of delight which Isa expected
to call up in the black eyes of her little maid, an anxious
look of inquiry filled them.</p>

<p>“O Miss Isa! I know I bees awkward, I did break
another saucer last night—but—but won’t you give me
a little longer trial?”</p>

<p>Isa was amused at the confession, made with evident
effort, for the blood rushed to the face of the simple girl
as she spoke. “I had no thought of sending you away,
Lottie,” said the young mistress, kindly; “but if you
would like to pass a couple of days with your mother,
Mrs. Holdich will give you a seat in her cart which is
going on Saturday to Axe.”</p>

<p>It was pleasant to Isa to see the sudden transition to
joy on the countenance of her little servant; Lottie
clapped her hands like a child to whom a holiday is
promised. With a heart warmed by the sight of the
innocent happiness which she had given, Isa Gritton
opened the door of her brother’s study, and entered the
dull apartment with a light step and radiant smile, like
one whose presence could make “sunshine in a shady
place.” Gaspar was seated by a fireless grate; though
shivering with chilliness, he would not indulge in a fire
in April. He certainly looked even more sickly than
usual, and Isa felt her cheerfulness damped at once as,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
without rising, her brother held out two cold fingers to
her, with the dry observation, “So you can actually
leave the delights of the Castle for an hour, to see if your
brother be dead or alive!”</p>

<p>“Nay, dear Gaspar,” said Isa, expostulatingly, as she
seated herself by his side, “if I thought that you needed
my society—that I could be a real comfort to you—” she
stopped short, being too candid to make empty professions,
and not having made up her mind how far she
could truthfully go.</p>

<p>“I don’t care for words, I like deeds,” observed Gaspar,
coldly; “women always can talk.”</p>

<p>The fresh, bright colour which Isa had brought in from
her walk over the common, deepened a little on her cheek,
but she had resolved to be patient and cheerful, and let
her visit give nothing but pleasure. Though it might
be scarcely necessary to tell Gaspar that she had given a
holiday to her young maid, it occurred to Isa that it
might be well to show him the deference of asking his
consent.</p>

<p>“Lottie would be very glad to see her mother,”
observed Isa after a short silence; “she is a poor,
shy little bird, that has never before left the nest; Mrs.
Holdich has arranged to make all easy for her going
on Saturday to Axe, if you’ll kindly give her leave
for two days.”</p>

<p>“I shall do no such thing,” replied Gaspar, peevishly;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
“I don’t give a girl wages for going to see her
mother.”</p>

<p>Isa was a little annoyed, but without betraying that
she felt so, observed, “I am sure that Hannah would
manage nicely without her for so short a time. You
know, Gaspar, that you yourself thought a second servant
unnecessary here.”</p>

<p>“I do so still,” said Mr. Gritton, taking a pinch of
snuff; “but as long as I keep two, I’ll have the services
for which I pay.”</p>

<p>“But, Gaspar, I hope that this time—as a personal
favour to myself—you will graciously grant leave of absence.
I have given Lottie hopes, or rather permission
to go to her mother; it would vex me were she to be disappointed.”</p>

<p>Lottie herself had just opened the door, having come
to ask Miss Isa if she would not take some refreshment
after her walk. She caught Isa’s last sentence, and stood
with her hand on the door-handle, quite innocent of any
intention of eavesdropping, but too anxious to hear her
master’s answer to think of anything else.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve given permission, have you! then I don’t
see why you should take the trouble of asking mine,”
said Gaspar, ungraciously. “Let her go, it is nothing to
me; I don’t care if she stay away altogether, an awkward,
clumsy gipsy-girl, not worth the salt that she eats.”</p>

<p>Lottie retreated, closing the door behind her, and ran<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
hastily up-stairs to indulge in a good hearty cry. Isa saw
the poor girl retiring, and was annoyed at the mortification
so needlessly inflicted on a warm young heart.</p>

<p class="caption">LOTTIE’S GRIEF.</p>
</div>

<p>Gaspar having, though so uncourteously, yielded the
point in question, his sister changed the subject of conversation.
She drew from her bag a copy of the <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>“I did not forget your wishes, Gaspar; but my uncle
would be glad to have the paper back, as he has the
<i>Times</i> bound at the end of the year.”</p>

<p>Gaspar took the periodical without thanks, and prepared
himself for the enjoyment of its perusal by a copious
pinch of snuff, scattering the brown powder as he did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
so over the printed sheet. Isa knew that the baronet
was very particular about his papers, and mentally resolved
never again to ask for a loan of the <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>Gaspar pushed his chair round towards the light, and
settled himself to read, taking no further notice of Isa,
who sat undecided whether to remain or to leave him to
the occupation which he evidently found more interesting
than her society. Isa had stored her memory with little
anecdotes and small scraps of news which she thought
might amuse the recluse, but Gaspar showed no wish to
enter into conversation. His sister thought with regret
of the time when they used to meet in London under
the roof of a friend, when her brother had appeared to her
to be all courtesy and kindness.</p>

<p>“Does he love me less because he knows me better?”
was the disheartening thought which crossed her
mind.</p>

<p>Mr. Gritton read for some minutes in silence, and Isa
was thinking of rising to depart, when, looking over his
newspaper, her brother suddenly addressed her.</p>

<p>“Isa, have you ever met that woman?”</p>

<p>“I do not know of whom you are speaking,” answered
Isa.</p>

<p>“Cora Madden, of course,” said Gaspar. “I repeat—have
you ever met her?”</p>

<p>“Yes; several times, years ago,” replied his sister.</p>

<p>“And did you ever speak to her; did you come upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
the subject of—of—what we were speaking about the
other morning?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” answered Isa; “I have never seen
her since my loss; of our dear father’s last words I have
spoken to no one but yourself; I was not even aware of
the name of the orphan to whom he referred.”</p>

<p>Gaspar fixed on his sister a gaze so keen and suspicious
that it aroused in her bosom an emotion of indignation.
“Were you intimate with her, or with any of the
Maddens?” he inquired, in the tone of a lawyer cross-questioning
a witness. Isa shrank as if his rough hand
had touched a scarcely healed wound.</p>

<p>“I was never intimate with Cora,” she replied; “it
seemed to me that she disliked me, but I never knew till
now that she had any cause to do so.”</p>

<p>“She had no cause—none—none,” said Gaspar, almost
stuttering in the eagerness of his denial. “I told you
and I tell you again, that you utterly mistook the meaning
of that message from my father. I could not help
the ship going down—I had always dealt fairly by Miss
Madden.”</p>

<p>There are occasions when something in the manner of
a speaker serves not only to neutralize the force of his
words, but actually to impress on the hearer a strong
contradiction of the meaning intended. Such was the
case with Gaspar’s. Isa had had a suspicion that her
brother had wronged Cora in some pecuniary matter, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
his manner of denying it changed suspicion into conviction,
and it kindled her indignation to believe that he
was now adding falsehood to fraud. The very air of the
room grew oppressive to Isa, the presence of Gaspar was
painful, and when Mr. Gritton, after his stammered-forth
declaration, became again absorbed in the <i>Times</i>, making
the rustling paper a screen between himself and his
sister, Isa rose, unwilling to prolong so unpleasant a visit.
The parting between brother and sister was cold and
constrained; Gaspar saw that he had not satisfied Isa,
and mingled resentment, fear, and shame, struggled together
in his breast. Isa gave a long-drawn sigh of relief
when she found herself again in the open air, and
could turn her back upon Wildwaste Lodge.</p>

<p>“I am certain that wrong has been done,” thought
Isa, as she slowly bent her steps towards Bolder’s dwelling,
“but it is not for me to repair it. Cora has been
sent poverty, doubtless, as a well-merited chastisement;
let me banish the subject from my mind. But why is it
that my interest in the orphan’s cause has so much cooled
since I have learned that orphan’s name? Why is it
that even with my distress and shame on account of my
unhappy brother there is mingled—dare I own it—something
that resembles a feeling of gratified revenge! Here,
indeed, is a Midianite in the soul! Cora is the only
being upon earth whom I regard with actual aversion,
but I knew not till now how such aversion could warp<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
my sense of justice—of right! Oh! what revelations
God makes to us of the evil lurking within our own
hearts, which the world had not suspected, which we had
never suspected ourselves!”</p>

<p>To Isa’s self-reproach was added another emotion as
painful,—the fear that duty might call for some effort on
her part to set right what was wrong, to work on the
conscience of her brother, to try to induce him to retrace
his steps if he had wandered from the path of rectitude.
Isa trembled at the very thought of what might lie before
her; never previously had duty worn to her an aspect
so repulsive. Isa knew that she ought to endeavour,
by self-denying kindness, to strengthen her influence
over Gaspar; that it should be one of the chief objects
of her life to win his confidence and his love; instead of
doing this, she could not help perceiving with mortification
that, since coming to Wildwaste, she had been
steadily losing ground in the affections of her brother.
He thought her selfish, worldly, indifferent to his comfort.
Could it be that she was indeed so? Were her
most pure and innocent earthly enjoyments becoming a
snare to her soul?</p>

<p>Such distressing reflections kept Isa very silent as she
retraced her steps towards Castle Lestrange by the side
of Rebekah Holdich. The steward’s wife had too much
delicacy to intrude conversation where she saw that it
would not be welcome; she perceived that the short visit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
to the Lodge had had the effect of damping the spirits
of Miss Gritton. Rebekah’s own heart, on the contrary,
was filled with gladness, on account of the change which
she had found in one who had once appeared to her hard
and unimpressionable as granite. Tychicus had ever
seemed to Rebekah an opinionative, self-righteous man,
and though she had pitied his sufferings, and had done
what she could to relieve them, her compassion for the
invalid had not been strengthened by personal regard.
But on this day Rebekah had found Tychicus softened,
humbled, subdued. She had heard him for the first time
own that it had been good for him to be afflicted, for he
had learned more of himself and of his Saviour in trouble
than he had ever known in prosperous days. The furnace
was doing its work; and while Mrs. Bolder plaintively
lamented that her husband must be “down in
heart, to do himself such injustice,” her friend was
secretly rejoicing that the Pharisee as well as the publican
may be led to cry, “God be merciful to me a sinner!”</p>

<p>“I remember,” thought Rebekah, “what Mr. Eardley
once said to my boy when he stood watching a caterpillar
spinning a very beautiful cocoon. ‘God sets that
little creature a task to do, and diligently and skilfully
he does it; and so God gives us good works to perform
in His name and for His sake. But were the insect to
remain satisfied for ever in the silken ball which he is
weaving, it would become not his home but his tomb.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
No; forcing a way through it, and not resting in it, will
the winged creature reach sunshine and air. He must
leave his own works behind, if he would shine in freedom
and joy. And so it is with the Christian. If he <i>rest in
his own works</i>, whatever they may be, he is dead to God
and lost to glory; he is making of what he may deem
<i>virtues</i> a barrier between himself and his Saviour.’
Yes,” mused Rebekah; “God be praised that poor
Bolder is making his way through the silken web;
he is feeling the need of other righteousness than his
own.”</p>

<p>As soon as Isa arrived at the Castle, she tried to put
away all remembrance of her painful visit to Wildwaste,
but it haunted her during the greater part of the day.
In the evening, however, when a circle of friends
gathered around Sir Digby’s hospitable board, her efforts
were more successful. Isa was naturally formed both to
attract in society and to enjoy it; she delighted in “the
feast of reason and the flow of soul;” her spirits had the
elasticity of youth, and as she sat at the head of her
uncle’s table, with everything that could please and
gratify around her, Isa felt that life might still become
to her a bright and joyous thing. Her soul was as a
well-tuned harp, giving out cheerful and harmonious
music, till a few sentences overheard of the conversation
between two of the guests jarred on her as if a discordant
string had been suddenly touched, and brought the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
shadow of past trial over the brightness of present
enjoyment.</p>

<p>“You know Lionel Madden, then?”</p>

<p>“A little; his wife I have known for the last thirty
years. I hear that their union is by no means a happy
one; but what else could be expected when she married
only for the sake of a handsome face, and he for that of
a handsome fortune?”</p>

<p>“They say that Miss Madden made the match.”</p>

<p>“She certainly did,” was the reply. “Cora had lost
almost all her own money in some unlucky investment,
so was resolved that her brother at least should keep a
carriage. But in the case of the Maddens the driving
fell to the share of the ladies, and the bride found that,
as two suns cannot shine in one orbit, so two sisters-in-law
cannot yield one whip, and poor Cora was, metaphorically
speaking, very speedily left on the road.”</p>

<p>Isa felt her cheeks glow at this incidental mention of
those whose fates had been so closely linked with her
own, and, perhaps to cover her emotion, said in a very
low voice to Mr. Eardley, who was seated beside her,
“Do you not count the light gossip which sports with
the characters and concerns of the absent, amongst ‘the
Midianites in the soul’?”</p>

<p>“I should count as such everything that mars the
charity or spirituality of Christians,” replied the clergyman.
“Such things are, indeed, like Midian, a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
host; not one giant foe to be overcome once and for
ever, but a legion that incessantly harass, whether in the
circles of society, or in the sacred central point of
home.”</p>

<p>The last word recalled to Isa’s mind the image of an
invalid brother, left in dull loneliness; and a slight
scarcely audible sigh, told of a secret emotion of self-reproach
and misgiving.</p>

<p class="dropcap">On Friday evening Mr. Eardley, in the cottage of
Holdich, went on with the history which he
had chosen as his theme.</p>

<h3>LECTURE III.—FAITH IN OBEDIENCE.</h3>

<p>We are to-day to examine faith in a further state of
development. If only the green leaves of hope appear,
if—as with the barren fig-tree in the parable—there
be no fruit, or promise of fruit, hope itself becomes
but self-deception. <i>Why call ye Me Lord, Lord, and do
not the things which I say?</i> asked the Saviour; <i>If ye
love Me, keep My commandments.</i> Faith must blossom
into obedience, as we see the fruit-trees in our orchards
now bursting into brightness and beauty. Yes;
obedience is the blossom, and the essence of its fragrance,
<i>self-denial</i>. In heaven obedience is ever a source of
delight; but in a world of sin like this, it must, sooner
or later, involve a sacrifice of the human will to the
divine. Sweet to our Lord is the fragrance which rises<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
like incense when the lips of his servant—tempted and
tried—can echo the words once breathed from His own
to His Father in heaven, <i>Not as I will, but as Thou wilt</i>.</p>

<p>Gideon had received a promise from the Lord: it was
linked, as God’s promises ever are, with a command.
That night the Lord thus spake to the son of Joash:
“Take thy father’s young bullock, even the second
bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of
Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that
is by it; and build an altar unto the Lord thy God
upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take
the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the
wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.”</p>

<p>Many difficulties lay in the way of the execution of
such a command, and obedience to it must be fraught
with great danger. We should not have marvelled had
we found that Gideon had pleaded to be spared a part
at least of the painful task assigned him. He was not
of the tribe to which pertained the service of the
sanctuary; he had, under ordinary circumstances, no
right to offer such a sacrifice to God. His own father
was an idolater: was it for Gideon to destroy what a
parent had set up, to draw down upon himself, as might
be expected, the severe displeasure of that parent, and
perhaps involve Joash in the peril to which he himself
would be certainly exposed? Then—as Gideon might
have anxiously reflected—as it would be impossible for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
him by the strength of his single right hand to cut down
a grove, destroy an altar, and build another as God had
commanded, where was he to find comrades trusty enough
and bold enough to help in the perilous work?</p>

<p>Gideon is not represented in the sacred narrative as a
man likely to rush heedlessly upon an enterprise of
difficulty and danger, and such thoughts as I have suggested
are likely to have passed through his mind.
They would have led many in his place to frame excuses,
or at least to interpose delays. But we hear not of
Gideon doing either. A direct command had been given;
simple, unquestioning obedience followed. Gideon took
ten men of his servants, and did as the Lord had said
unto him. Conscious of danger to be apprehended, not
only from the Midianites and the men of his own city,
but even from the household of his father, the son of
Joash chose the night-time to accomplish his task.
Under the cover of darkness, when other eyes were
closed in sleep, Gideon and his companions felled the
trees of the grove, cast down the altar of Baal, and raised
another to Israel’s God. They led thither the appointed
sacrifice, slew the bullock, and set fire to the wood, from
whence the smoke of the burnt-offering rose towards heaven.
That was a busy, an eventful, and must have been an
anxious night to Gideon. By so decisive an act, he had
indeed drawn the sword and thrown the scabbard away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus11.jpg" width="500" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE ALTAR RAISED.</p>
</div>

<p>The deed was done, the match was laid to the train,
and Gideon must have awaited in anxious expectation
the explosion which was certain to follow. The morning’s
light revealed the work of the night; the idolatrous
men of the city beheld the altar of Baal laid low<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
in the dust, and from mouth to mouth passed the question,
“Who hath done this thing?” If Gideon had entertained
any hope of concealment, that hope was a brief
one; either one of his comrades had turned informer, or
some lurking spy had witnessed his act, or, as seems
more probable, he had already won such a character for
uncompromising fidelity to his God, that suspicion
instantly fixed upon him as the man who had dared to
cut down the grove, and destroy the idol-altar. “Gideon,
the son of Joash, hath done this thing.”</p>

<p>Then rose the furious cry for blood from the enraged
worshippers of Baal. They demanded the life of the
man who had dared to insult their god.</p>

<p>The Almighty raised up a protector for Gideon. It
was the altar of an idolatrous father which he had cast
down, and we might have expected the fury of Joash to
have been turned against him; but the hearts of all men
are in the hand of the Lord, and we find Joash suddenly
in the character of a defender of his son’s bold act.
Many a prayer may have risen from the depth of Gideon’s
soul when he beheld his father, a descendant of Abraham,
debasing himself by worshipping Baal. His own noble
deed seems to have had the effect of opening the eyes of
his parent to the folly of bowing down to an idol that
could not protect his shrine from insult. With spirit
and courage Joash faced those who would have sacrificed
to vengeance the life of his son. “Will ye plead for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
Baal?” he cried; “will ye save him? He that will
plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet
morning; if he be a god, let him plead for himself,
because one hath cast down his altar!” and Joash called
Gideon Jerubbaal, “let Baal plead,” in mockery of the
false god to whom he himself had once bowed down.</p>

<p>We are not directly told what was the effect of Joash’s
speech on the men of his city, Abiezer, but we can easily
gather what it was from the recorded fact that on
Gideon’s blowing a trumpet they were the first to rally
around him; they who had demanded his blood now
acknowledged him as their leader. A spirit of patriotism
appears to have been suddenly roused in Israel, and the
people, in throwing off the bonds of superstition and
idolatry, rose also to shake off the fetters of their earthly
oppressors. Messengers were sent by Gideon throughout
Manasseh, and to Asher, Zebulon, and Naphtali. From
the slopes of Hermon and Tabor, from the shores of the
Lake of Gennesareth, from the banks of the Jordan, from
that northern portion of Canaan in which, in after times,
the Saviour spent the years of His boyhood, hastened the
liberators of Israel at the call of their Heaven-appointed
chief. Nor was the enemy idle. The Midianites, the
Amalekites, and the children of the East gathered
together, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel. That
valley and the country adjacent are full of historical
associations of deep interest. Jezreel appears to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
been in the centre of the great plain of Esdraelon, or
Megiddo, which is bounded on the north by the mountains
of Galilee, on the south by those of Samaria, and
in which flow the water of Kishon, “that ancient river”
which swept away Sisera’s hosts. Well might the triumphant
song of Deborah here recur to Gideon, to brace
up his soul for the coming conflict. He saw around him
the warriors of Zebulon and Naphtali, the tribes who,
under Barak, <i>jeoparded their lives unto the death in the
high places of the field</i>. Joash himself may have been
one of the heroes who had <i>willingly offered themselves</i>
to oppose the might of Sisera, and may have heard from
the lips of the prophetess the strain of triumph which
closed with the words, <i>So let all Thine enemies perish,
O Lord: but let them that love Him be as the sun when
he goeth forth in his might</i>.</p>

<p>And now we behold the young Manassite, who was
so lately threshing corn alone by the wine-press to hide
it, a general at the head of an army of thirty-two
thousand men. Such success, such a blessing had
followed on faith shown in obedience! And here let us
leave Gideon, and apply to ourselves the lesson conveyed
in his marvellous story.</p>

<p>Every command of our heavenly Master, my brethren,
is as a treasure-casket, to be opened by the key of
obedience grasped in the hand of faith. The casket may
to our eyes look hard and repulsive, the tempter may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
seek to persuade us that we shall either find it empty,
or filled with bitterest gall. But <i>wait on the Lord, and
keep His way, and He shall exalt thee. The blessing of
the Lord it maketh rich, and He addeth no sorrow with
it.</i> Look at Noah, employed during <i>a hundred and
twenty years</i>, amidst the mocking and scorn of a most
wicked generation, in building an enormous ark in
obedience to God’s command. What did he find at last
in it to reward his labour of patience, his obedience of
faith. Present deliverance from death for himself and
his family, and the sceptre of a renovated world!
Remember Abraham and his anguish when he received
the mysterious command to sacrifice his son—the son
whom he tenderly loved. Did not the tempter urge him
in that awful hour to cast away his obedience, to turn
from a command which to human nature appeared so
hard? The hand of faith might tremble, but it refused
not the awful task; and what lay enclosed within the
dreaded command? A treasure compared to which
earth’s crowns are but baubles, and all its riches dust.
The promise of a Saviour to spring from Abraham’s line,
in whom all the families of the earth should be blessed!</p>

<p>We also have before us commands enclosing blessings
reserved for those to whom grace is given to obey God’s
will through the power of faith. In the difficult task
appointed for Gideon we may trace an emblem of that
set before every individual who bears the name of Christian.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
There is first the altar of Baal to be thrown down;
<i>self</i> must be dethroned from its shrine, the heart’s idolatry
must be renounced; and who can say that to yield up
self-will is not as difficult a duty as that which Gideon
performed on that eventful night at Ophrah? There is
also the grove to be cut down, a type of those things
lawful and even beautiful in themselves, but which
become to us snares if they stand in the way of duty, if
they hide from us heaven’s light. God hath given to us
all things richly to enjoy; but if the gifts make us forget
the Giver, if they cause us to neglect appointed duties,
they are as the goodly trees by the altar of Baal, whose
wood was to be used as fuel, and not reserved for shade.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there is the altar to be raised, the appointed
sacrifice to be offered. I need scarcely remind you, my
friends, that in this sacrifice there is <i>nothing of atonement</i>—the
blood of Christ, and that <i>alone</i>, has power to
cleanse from sin, or to reconcile the sinner to God; yet
is the Christian permitted, yea, <i>commanded</i>, to offer himself
a living sacrifice, <i>holy, acceptable unto God</i>. As
Gideon was not of the priestly tribe, and yet was given
special grace to perform the priestly office, so the Lord
deigns to make of His ransomed servants <i>a royal priesthood</i>
as well as <i>a peculiar people</i>. Christ’s sacrifice was
the Sacrifice of Atonement; the sacrifice of His saints is
that of thanksgiving. <i>The offering of a free heart will
I give Thee, O Lord, and praise Thy name.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>To each one amongst us to whom a present Saviour
has been revealed by faith, the word of the Lord hath
come as to the son of Joash. We may have rejoiced in
the <i>promise</i>, but have we obeyed the command? Let us
be honest with ourselves, my brethren; if the altar of
Baal be yet standing, can we hope to drive the Midianites
out of the land? Faith, if <i>real</i>, must appear in
obedience; <i>show me thy faith without thy works, and I
will show thee my faith by my works</i>, saith the inspired
apostle. I commend the subject to your earnest attention.
Let each search and try his own heart, and compare his
life with the law of his God. Let each remember that
even <i>every thought</i> must be brought captive to the
obedience of Christ, through the aid of the Holy Spirit,
without whom we can do nothing pleasing to the Lord.
I cannot better close our meditation on this subject than
by repeating the words of our Redeemer in His Sermon
on the Mount:—<i>Whosoever heareth these sayings of
Mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man,
which built his house upon a rock: and the rain descended,
and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon
that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.
And every one that heareth these sayings of Mine, and
doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which
built his house upon the sand: and the rain descended,
and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon
that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">After the close of the service, Isa, as before,
spoke to her little black-eyed maid, and inquired
after the health of Gaspar.</p>

<p>“Master has caught cold in his eyes, and
he says it’s east wind, and shuts himself up.
He can’t read, nor write, and he seems very dull-like,”
said Lottie, whose own sunburnt face was bright with the
anticipated holiday before her.</p>

<p>Isa sent a message to Mr. Gritton, and after exchanging
a few words with Henry Eardley, left the cottage
with Edith Lestrange. The little heiress thought her
cousin unusually silent as they walked back to the
Castle.</p>

<p>“Edith, dear,” said Isa at last, “I am going to return
to Wildwaste to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Not to stay there, I hope,” cried Edith.</p>

<p>“Yes, to stay there,” replied Isa, suppressing a sigh.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
“I feel that poor Gaspar needs me; I think that my
right place is home.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is,” said Edith, reluctantly. Unwilling
as she was to part with her cousin, Edith’s own views
were clear on the subject; the nearest relation had the
nearest claim—nothing would have induced her to leave
her own father when he needed the comfort of her
presence. Edith thought it wrong to try to prevent Isa
from doing what she would have thought it right to do
in her place.</p>

<p>The baronet was not, however, so forbearing. When
his niece announced to him her intention of leaving the
Castle on the following day, he playfully but strongly
opposed her resolution. Sir Digby justly considered that
Isa’s companionship was both a pleasure and an advantage
to his child, while her lively conversation and intelligence
made it also agreeable to himself. Sir Digby felt that
his graceful niece was an ornament to his Castle, and
would fain have ignored altogether her connection with
“a low man retired from business, who had disfigured
the neighbourhood by sticking up on the heath a cockney
villa, which only wanted a swinging sign to be mistaken
for a newly built public-house.”</p>

<p>“Having you safe here in ward in this our Castle,
we shall certainly not let our prisoner go, save on parole
to return within two hours,” said the baronet; “Edith,
I commit the charge of our captive to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>“But what if I am a warder not to be trusted?”
asked Edith, with a smile; “what if I connive at the
captive’s escape?”</p>

<p>“Seriously, Isa,” said Sir Digby, “you cannot think
of going back so soon to that—that damp and not very
cheerful locality;” the baronet did not know how to
designate the dwelling itself by any term combining
courtesy with truth.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I must return to my brother,” said Isa.</p>

<p>“You will stay over Sunday, at least. I have an
idea—I believe that you like attending the service at
Axe.”</p>

<p>How greatly Isa enjoyed the Sundays spent with the
Lestranges the baronet knew not. The devotional spirit
which breathed through the church service was refreshing
and reviving to her soul. To Mr. Eardley Isa looked up
as the most faithful of pastors and the holiest of men;
she met him not unfrequently at the Castle, and the
deeper the knowledge that the young maiden gained of
the sterling qualities of his character, the more she
wondered that her eyes had ever been dazzled by unsubstantial
tinsel, and the more grateful she felt to God for
having preserved her from the effects of her own folly.
Isa would probably have yielded to the temptation to
“stay over Sunday,” but for the reflections which the
story of Gideon had suggested to her mind. The grove,
emblem of things in themselves lawful and desirable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
which become snares when they stand in the way of
duty, might not Isa find its counterpart in the pleasures
of Castle Lestrange? Isa thought of the throwing down
of self-will, the sacrifice of inclination, and so resisted the
kind pressing of her uncle, and the more powerful pleading
of her own wishes.</p>

<p>Edith ordered the carriage on the following morning
to take her cousin to Wildwaste; she would herself
accompany her thither. Isa would have liked to have
asked her young companion to stay and spend the day at
the Lodge, to brighten its dulness with her society; but
in Gaspar’s nervous and irritable state, Isa feared that a
visitor might annoy him, especially on a Saturday morning,
which was always given to accounts. Edith, with
instinctive delicacy, removed any difficulty on the part
of her cousin, by saying that she would not this time
remain to pay her visit, but drive on beyond Wild waste
to return the call of some neighbouring family.</p>

<p>“While I am at Wildwaste, however, I should like
just to look into the little school,” said Edith, as she and
her cousin were driving from Castle Lestrange.</p>

<p>“I have been into it two or three times,” observed Isa,—“I
mean into the room in which Mrs. Collins teaches
the girls; I have never yet ventured amongst the boys—the
young savages who look so ragged and wild.”</p>

<p>“Oh! they are polished gentlemen compared to what
they were when Mr. Arthur first took them in hand; so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
Mrs. Holdich has told me,” laughed Edith. “They were
like a pack of wild dogs, delighting to torment and worry
every creature unfortunate enough to come within their
reach, from poor little unfledged sparrows to Mrs. Stone’s
son, whom they actually hunted into fits!”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Arthur found some one to bring them into
a little better order.”</p>

<p>“Nay, he set about taming them himself; he used to
go every morning to play schoolmaster; the ragged little
urchins thought it a grand thing to be taught by a gentleman
like him. How good does constantly come out of
what we call evil!” cried Edith. “Papa did so much
dislike letting the dear old Castle to strangers; but if he
had not done so, Wildwaste would never have had the
blessing of an Arthur Madden.”</p>

<p>“He must have had a kind, generous spirit,” observed
Isa rather dreamily, for every reference to the Madden
family sent her thoughts back strangely to the past.</p>

<p>“A brave, noble spirit,” cried Edith; “for I have
heard that he stood so alone in his labours; instead of
his family encouraging and helping him, he was laughed
at and opposed—at least by his elder brother and sister.
They would, I fancy, as soon have thought of going
steadily to work as ‘hands’ in that great soap-manufactory,
amongst all the smoke and horrible scent, as
of teaching dirty, ragged little ‘roughs’ their A B C in
a shed! I cannot imagine Cora Madden touching one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
of the Wildwaste children with the point of her parasol;
and from what one hears of her brother Lionel—but I
am getting into evil-speaking,” said Edith interrupting
herself. “There is the pretty little school-house, which
it must have been such a pleasure to design and build.
Papa says that when Arthur Madden returns to England
he will certainly ask him to pay a visit to the Castle, for
such public spirit ought to be countenanced. But I dare
say that Mr. Madden wants no praise—no honour from
man—that he serves his heavenly Master in the spirit
expressed in my favourite verses;” and in her soft, almost
childish accents, Edith repeated Bonar’s beautiful lines,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Up and away like the dew of the morning,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Soaring from earth to its home in the sun;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So let me steal away gently and lovingly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Only remembered by what I have done.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My name, and my place, and my tomb all forgotten,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The brief race of life well and patiently run;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So let me pass away peacefully, silently,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Only remembered by what I have done.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Before Edith had concluded the verses, the carriage
had stopped at the entrance to the little school-house, on
the side appropriated to the girls.</p>

<p>“The hive seems to be empty,” observed Isa, as she
alighted. “I thought that work was always going
on at this hour, but I hear no hum of voices from
within.”</p>

<p>A feeble wail was the only audible sound. After<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
tapping gently at the door, Isa entered, followed by her
cousin, into the neat little school-room, which usually
presented a scene of cheerful industry. Its only occupants
were, however, the schoolmistress and the babe
which she rocked in her arms. The poor woman looked
haggard and pale from a sleepless night, her face bore the
stamp of anxious care, and vainly she attempted to soothe
the little sufferer, that seemed from its wasted appearance
not to have many more days to live. Mrs. Collins rose
on the entrance of the ladies, still continuing to rock her
sick babe.</p>

<p>“Pray do not rise, Mrs. Collins; I fear that your dear
child is very poorly,” said Isa, looking with gentle
sympathy on the suffering infant.</p>

<p>The schoolmistress sank down again on her seat, and
drew a heavy sigh as she answered, “The doctor thinks
I shall lose her: I did not close an eye all last night: I
really could not hold the school this morning: it is the
first time that ever I sent the children away, but Mrs.
Bolder has taken charge of even my own little boys—I
could not bear the noise for poor baby.” Mrs. Collins
spoke apologetically, as one who fears that she is neglecting
a duty. Isa’s expression of sympathy encouraged her
to proceed: “I am afraid that I shall have to tell the
girls not to come to-morrow: my husband cannot undertake
them as well as the boys, for neither of the rooms
would hold all together.”</p>

<p class="caption">THE VISIT TO WILDWASTE SCHOOL.</p>
</div>

<p>“Have you to teach on Sundays as well as on week-days?”
asked Edith.</p>

<p>“Only for an hour before morning service, and
another in the afternoon, Miss Lestrange. I’m sorry to
give it up even for one Sunday, for few of the children
ever see the inside of a church; and but for the school, as
Mr. Bolder used to say, they would grow up like heathen.”
Mrs. Collins was still rocking the baby, that, to her great
relief, was at length dropping asleep in her arms.</p>

<p>“Shall I come to-morrow and take your class?” asked
Isa. “I have had little experience in tuition, but I
could read to the girls, teach them hymns, and question<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
them out of the Bible, while you sit quietly upstairs
nursing your poor little child.”</p>

<p>The look of gratitude in the eyes of the anxious mother
said more than her words, as she eagerly accepted the
young lady’s offer.</p>

<p>“And I will see if there is not something that I can
send to do the dear baby good,” said Edith, resolved to
drive back and consult Mrs. Holdich on the subject.</p>

<p>The cousins left the school-room with a pleasant consciousness
that they had lightened a heavy burden. To
Isa, especially, the feeling was sweet. What she had
heard of the labours of Arthur Madden had raised the
thought in her mind, “Oh, that I could <i>go and do likewise</i>;
that I too could leave a blessing behind, and be ‘remembered
by what I had done!’” At once a door of usefulness
was opened before her. Why should she not
every Sunday relieve the hard-worked schoolmistress,
and let the weary mother enjoy amidst her children what
would then be a Sabbath indeed? Isa had for a few
weeks taught a Bible-class in London; she liked the
work, it gave interest to life, it took away the sense of
weariness and emptiness which will sometimes creep over
the spirit even of the lovely and young. Isa knew the
task of tuition would be far lighter to her than it had
been to the young man whose example was before her:
she would go where she would be welcomed, amongst
children already trained to some degree of order: she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
would have no opposition or ridicule to fear; for Gaspar,
so long as she made no demands on her purse, was contented
to let his sister do very much as she pleased.
That brief visit to the school-room had to Isa changed
greatly the aspect of life at Wildwaste. Her Sundays
at least would not be joyless; she was permitted to do
the Lord’s work, she might hope for His presence and
blessing. She had made a sacrifice of inclination by returning
to Wildwaste, and she was beginning to see that
even in that dreary place God might give her rich cause
for rejoicing.</p>

<p>“Yes; I shall be happier even here, trying to please
my heavenly Master, than at Castle Lestrange, with the
feeling ever arising that I am seeking to please self
alone.”</p>

<p>It was this thought that made Isa Gritton bear
patiently the dull monotony of the home to which she
had returned, and the wayward fretfulness of him whose
society now replaced that in which she had found such
delight. Though Gaspar’s temper was more than usually
trying, not once did a peevish tone betray irritation, not
once did a frown furrow Isa’s fair brow. For hours, on
the evening after her return, Isa sat reading aloud to her
brother a work upon commercial statistics, in which she
herself took not a shadow of interest. Certainly her
mind wandered much from the book, and when at length
she wearily closed it, Isa could not have recalled a single<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
sentence which it contained. But she had been serving
an invalid brother and not pleasing herself; and if this
duty was less attractive than that of feeding the Saviour’s
lambs, it was equally that which He had assigned her,
and it was fulfilled for His sake.</p>

<p>Mankind applaud great acts of munificence, costly
offerings presented like those of Solomon in open day, in
the sight of all; but by far the greater number of the
sacrifices which God accepts are made, as it were, like
Gideon’s, in the night-time, in the obscurity of domestic
life, where no praise is looked for from man. There is
deep truth in the well-known lines of Keble,—</p>

<h3>TIDINGS.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-e.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Early on the Saturday afternoon Lottie Stone,
with her little bundle in her hand, tripped
lightly over the common towards the cottage
of Holdich, which lay embosomed within the
woods of Lestrange. She was on her way to
her parent’s home, and pleasure winged her steps. There
are few joys more keen and pure than those experienced
by a young girl, like Lottie, returning to the family
whom she loves, after her first absence. What though
Mrs. Stone’s dwelling-place was but a single room over a
shop, with a tiny attic chamber for her son; to Lottie
there was still a charm in the word “home,” for love
and peace abode there. She clapped her hands for joy
as the open cart in which she was seated rattled down
the narrow paved street of Axe, and she caught sight of
the ungainly figure of her only brother standing before
the shop. Out sprang Lottie almost before the horse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
was pulled up, and in another minute she was locked in
the arms of her mother.</p>

<p>How much had Lottie to tell; how fast she talked,
how merrily she laughed, as she sat at her mother’s
little deal table spread with unusual dainties—buttered
muffins, and toast, and water-cresses from the stream.
The washerwoman had “cleared up and made all tidy”
for the reception of her daughter; and her son had decked
the homely room with bunches of cowslips and daffodils.
Deborah’s care-worn brow seemed less deeply wrinkled,
and her thin anxious face often relaxed into a smile, as
her merry child talked over her first eventful month of
service, playfully describing what at the time of occurrence
had seemed to her anything but sources of mirth,—her
own petty troubles and ignorant blunders. Lottie’s
hearers drew from her recital that Hannah was a somewhat
formidable task-mistress, that “Master” was not
very easily pleased, that crockery at the Lodge had a
peculiar tendency to slip out of clumsy fingers, but that
“Miss Isa” was the kindest of mistresses, and that a
smile from her seemed to smooth every difficulty away.</p>

<p>“Bless your dear heart, how your poor father would
have liked to have heard you!” exclaimed Deborah
Stone, as the merry girl at length stopped to take
breath.</p>

<p>For the loyal heart of the deserted wife remained
true in its allegiance. Perhaps memory had softened the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
past, perhaps it overleaped the years of bitter suffering
on the one side and tyranny on the other, and Deborah
only thought of her husband as what he had been
in the days of his wooing. However that might be,
conjugal affection remained firm and bright like its
pledge, the circlet on the wrinkled bony finger, the sole
piece of gold which its owner possessed, and which no
strain of poverty would ever induce her to part with.
When Deborah knelt down in the evening to offer her
simple little prayer with her children, very fervent was
her supplication for one absent but never forgotten:
where Abner was she knew not, what Abner was she
had proved by bitter experience, but still, “true as the
needle to the pole,” the hopes and affections of the injured
woman still pointed towards her lost husband.</p>

<p>Sunday was an especially happy day to Lottie, it was
such a pleasure to go to what she deemed her own
church, hear her own pastor, meet again with her own
companions in the Sunday school which she used to
attend. She was only disappointed when the baronet’s
carriage drew up to the church-porch, not to see in it
the bright fair face of her dear young mistress.</p>

<p>“A letter for you, mother,” said Mrs. Stone’s son, as
he entered on the Monday morning the little room in
which Lottie, humming a lively air, was helping her
parent to clear away the remains of their early breakfast.
As Mrs. Stone’s receiving a letter of any kind was a quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
unprecedented occurrence, Lottie turned with some curiosity
to see what the missive could contain. It had
come by a cross-country post, for her brother pointed
to the stamp-mark upon it, “Southampton.”</p>

<p>“A letter for me?—why, who would write!” exclaimed
Deborah, gazing with a look rather of anxiety
than of curiosity on the address, “To D. Stone, Wildwast,”
traced in a straggling, hardly legible hand, with
“Try Axe” written below by the postmaster, showing
that her correspondent could not be aware that—years
ago—she had changed her abode. It was no wonder
that Deborah did not recognize that rude handwriting,
as she had seen it but once before, when, in the parish
register, she had scrawled her own signature beneath that
of her newly-wedded husband.</p>

<p>“O mother, do open it!” cried Lottie; “who knows
whether it mayn’t bring us news of poor father.”</p>

<p>It was the same thought that had made the hand of
Deborah tremble as she had taken the letter from her
son. She tore open the envelope, and with anxious
eyes glanced at the signature at the end of its enclosure.</p>

<p>“It is—yes—oh! the Lord is merciful!” exclaimed
the poor wife, with something like a sob. Long experience
of hardship and sorrow had so strengthened her
nature to endure, that it was very seldom that Deborah
gave any expression to outward emotion; but no one
could have looked at her at that moment and not have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
read in every line of her countenance that the depths of
her soul were stirred, that the few scarcely audible
words which escaped her lips came from the inmost
recesses of a heart where sorrow had so long fixed its
abode, that when joy came it startled and overpowered,
like the visit of an angel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus13.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE LETTER.</p>
</div>

<p>“Mother, read more; oh! read every word!” cried
Lottie, whose only emotions seemed those of hope and
delight; while her brother looked bewildered and scarcely
able to comprehend that that piece of paper, blotted and
soiled, on which his mother’s tears were falling, actually
contained the writing of his father.</p>

<p>It was some little time before the trembling, excited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
woman could, with the help of her children, make out
the scrawl, which read as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ancor inn, sutamton.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear wife</span>,—I landed here last month. I bin vry

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Abner Stone</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>“Five pounds—how can I send him five pounds—I’ve
not five shillings in the world!” cried Deborah, glancing
around her, as if to see whether any article in that
scantily furnished room could, if sold or pawned, bring
anything like such a sum, the fifth part of which she
had never possessed at one time since her marriage.</p>

<p>“Five pounds!” repeated her son dreamily, as he
slowly moved his fingers one after the other, apparently
to aid his dull brain in making some mental calculation.</p>

<p>“We must send, oh! we must send the money!”
cried Lottie, clasping her hands. “Dear Mr. Eardley
might—”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t ask him for another penny,” exclaimed
Deborah, “he has done so much already, and he has so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
many alooking to him; and then your father forbids me
to tell him a word.”</p>

<p>“If only Mr. Arthur were in England,” sighed Lottie.</p>

<p>“You earns wages,” said her brother abruptly, as if he
had suddenly lighted on some fountain of wealth.</p>

<p>“My quarter’s wages won’t be due till next June,”
replied Lottie.</p>

<p>“Could your master do anything?” suggested Deborah;
“it is said about here that he’s rich.”</p>

<p>Lottie shook her head with a very significant expression.
“He may have plenty of money,” she said slowly,
“but I’m sure he don’t like to part with it; there’s
nothing to be got out of he.”</p>

<p>“Here’s the baker’s cart come for you, Lottie,” cried
her brother, who had sauntered up to the window.</p>

<p>Lottie hurriedly snatched up her bonnet and shawl.
“I mustn’t keep him; but oh! mother, if I could only
think of any way to help father—” a loud summons
shouted from below cut her short in the middle of her
sentence, and quickened her movements.</p>

<p>“Pray, child, pray; God Almighty will show us some
way:” there was scarcely time for the parting kiss and
blessing; Lottie hurried down into the street barely soon
enough to prevent her impatient escort from driving
away without her.</p>

<p>Very different were the feelings of the young servant
girl on her drive from Axe, from those with which, two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
days before, she had entered the quaint little town. She
replied at random to the jesting observations of the
baker’s boy, she seemed unable to understand the meaning
of the words that fell on her ear, for her mind was
so full of conflicting emotions that outer things could
make no impression upon it. Lottie scarcely knew
whether she was happy or unhappy, whether her inclination
was to laugh or to cry. Her prayers had been
answered—her lost father was found; here indeed was
joy and cause for thanksgiving: but he was ill, in debt,
needed money, and where was that money to be procured?</p>

<p>“I would work my fingers to the bone!” muttered
Lottie to herself, as the cart rolled lightly along the
dusty high road, “but no working would bring more
than the one pound due in June;” and thoughts of the
new boots which would then be absolutely needed would
intrude on the little maid’s mind. “I can’t go about
Mr. Gritton’s house barefoot; and then he says that I
am to pay for all that I break, and, oh! the things <i>will</i>
slip out of my hands! Would my dear young lady help
me? but I must not tell even her that I want money
for my poor sick father. Shall I say that mother’s in
trouble for rent?” The honest soul of Lottie recoiled
from the artful suggestion of the Tempter, and she shook
her head so emphatically in reply to it, that the baker’s
boy, who had been watching with amusement her earnest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
look of thought and her moving lips, burst out into
a laugh which startled her into a consciousness that she
was not alone.</p>

<p>“I say, Lottie Stone, what did you see in that thorn
bush to make you shake your head at it so fiercely?”
cried the lad.</p>

<p>“I was only a-thinking,” replied Lottie.</p>

<p>“A penny for your thoughts,” said her companion.</p>

<p>But the answer was such a heavy sigh, that the good-humoured
lad saw that the little maiden was in no
mood for jesting, and as she turned her head sorrowfully
away, he left her in peace to pursue her reflections.</p>

<p>It was perhaps well for Lottie that she had not much
time for meditation after her arrival at the Lodge. Hard
work has served to relieve many an anxious heart, and
Hannah took care that her little assistant should have
her share, and much more than her share, of the labour
of the house. Lottie Stone had to pay by double work
for her two days’ holiday at Axe. Yet while she
washed, and scrubbed, and tidied the rooms, the thoughts
of the poor young girl were constantly recurring to her
father, and she was revolving the difficult problem how
it would be possible to procure five pounds to send to
her father before Thursday.</p>

<p>While Lottie was laying the cloth for dinner, she
could not help hearing the conversation going on between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
her master and his sister, relative to one of the children
of Isa’s Sunday class.</p>

<p>“I am certain that she is consumptive, and that
Wildwaste is too damp for the poor little thing. I hear
that the doctor has said that her only chance is to go
to the hospital at Bournemouth.”</p>

<p>“I’ve no faith in doctors,” said Gaspar, applying to
his snuff-box.</p>

<p>“If I myself had the means of sending her,” pursued
Isa, “I would never trouble you on the subject; but the
expenses will be heavy, and my purse is light, and—”</p>

<p>“It will always be light if you go picking up every
case that comes before you. You may throw away your
money if you choose, but I shall certainly not throw
away mine;” and, rising, Gaspar walked to the window,
to put an end to the conversation.</p>

<p>The words which she had heard fell like cold vapour
upon the heart of Lottie. “My poor dear mistress, though
she is a lady, has a light purse; she cannot do what she
wishes; she is obliged to beg her brother for money, and
he refuses to give it. Ah, there is no use in my asking
help from her! She has the will to do good, but not
the power; master has the power, but not the will.
People say as how he is rich; it don’t look like it, when
he’s so angry at the candles being used so fast. I’m
sure if I were rich—;” and here the little maid’s thoughts
flowed on fast in a channel into which they had often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
wandered before—how much good <i>she</i> would do if she
were rich—how much she wished that she had plenty of
money—how strange it was that some should be rolling
in wealth, while others had scarcely bread enough to
satisfy hunger. There are many through whose minds,
as through Lottie’s, such a current of reflection is wont
to run; but the little servant-maid suspected that there
was danger in giving it free course.</p>

<p>“I do believe that Mr. Eardley would say—could he
know of what I am thinking—that I am letting those
Midianites, Discontent and Distrust, into my foolish
little heart. It do seem as if I was beginning to think
everything wrong in God’s world, ’cause I can’t do what
I want for father. If I can’t ask Miss Isa to help me,
is there not One above whom I <i>can</i> ask, and who has
both the power and the will to do me good? I needn’t
be hiding nothing from God; He knows all already.
He has made poor father give up the drink, and has
brought him back to England, and has helped him over
his sickness, and now He can set him free from his debt.
I must pray very hard, and pray in faith, and <i>pray
without fainting</i>, and sure the answer will come at
last.”</p>

<p>And so, while she pursued her household labours, as
well as when she knelt by her bed-side at night; when
the duster or the broom was in her hand, as well as
when her Bible lay open before her, the simple-minded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
Lottie lifted up her heart to her Father in heaven,
and found comfort and hope in resting her cares upon
Him.</p>

<p>On the evening of the following day, Lottie accompanied
her mistress to the meeting at the cottage of
Holdich.</p>

<h3>LECTURE IV.—FAITH IN TRIAL.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">A very remarkable trial was now to test the
faith of Gideon. We left him in the proud
position of the leader of an army of thirty-two
thousand men; and we can imagine how
the heart of the patriot would swell with
thankfulness and joy, as the prospect of delivering his
country by their means brightened before him,—how he
would welcome the arrival of each brave band, and count
up the increasing number of his forces.</p>

<p>Further encouragement was given to Gideon by
miraculous signs vouchsafed to him by God in answer to
prayer. “If Thou wilt save Israel by my hand as Thou
hast said, behold,” cried Gideon, “I will put a fleece of
wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only,
and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I
know that Thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as Thou
hast said.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>Early on the morrow the chieftain arose, and sought
the fleece where he had laid it. He found it heavy with
moisture, though the ground lay dry around it; and
Gideon wrung out from the dripping wool a bowlful of
water.</p>

<p>Yet Gideon ventured to beseech God to grant a
reversal of this miraculous sign, in further confirmation
of his faith: “Let not Thine anger be hot against me,
and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray
Thee, but this once with the fleece. Let it now be dry
only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there
be dew.”</p>

<p>Even as Gideon had prayed, so was the sign vouchsafed;
the soft dew lay on the earth around, while the
fleece remained dry.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that in the fleece of Gideon we
may see not only a sign, but also a type of Israel, the
chosen people of God. The living water of divine truth,
the dew of a peculiar blessing, rested upon the children
of Abraham when the rest of the world was as a dry and
thirsty land. Now—alas for those who rejected, who
still reject their Messiah!—the sign is reversed. As a
dry fleece the Jews remain in the midst of Christian
nations, a marvel to the world; the dew which falls so
richly around them rests not on them as a people. Oh,
may God hasten the time when the Jews also shall
receive the water of life; when they <i>shall look on Him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
whom they pierced</i>; and when God shall make use of
them as His chosen instruments for the conversion of the
heathen! Looking forward to that blessed time, St.
Paul—himself a Jew—exclaims, <i>What shall the receiving
of them be but life from the dead?</i> Let us pray then,
my brethren, for the dew of grace to fall upon the dry
fleece, that Jerusalem, the city of the great King, may
once more become the joy of the earth.</p>

<p>Gideon, strengthened by signs from heaven, and surrounded
by the hosts of Israel, might now fearlessly and
confidently await the conflict with Midian; but he was
not only to do God’s work, but to do it in God’s
appointed way. <i>Not by might, nor by power, but by
My Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.</i> The Lord thus
spake unto Gideon: “The people that are with thee are
too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hands,
lest Israel vaunt themselves against Me, saying, Mine
own hand hath saved me. Now, therefore, go to, proclaim
in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is
fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from
Mount Gilead.”</p>

<p>In making such proclamation, Gideon was obeying a
command given through Moses (Deut. xx. 8), though it
is possible that he might have omitted to do so without
the special direction from above. Startling was the
effect of the proclamation, and it needed strong faith in
Gideon not to falter when the force of Israel began to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
melt away like a snow-ball, till more than two-thirds of
the whole number had deserted the camp. Truly many
had been called, but few were chosen. Where were
those who had so readily obeyed the call of the trumpet,
and quitted their homes for the field of war? Of how
many might it be said, <i>Being harnessed and carrying
bows, they turned back in the day of battle.</i> They were
not to share the glory; they had faltered in the moment
of trial. Oh, brethren, may it never be so with us!
May <i>the fear of man</i>, which <i>bringeth a snare</i>, never
make us shrink back from the duty before us. What
must have been the shame of those who had come to
the gathering of the hosts of Israel, and who had then
departed without striking one blow, when the rocks and
mountains rang with the shouts of their conquering
brethren, and the victory in which they might once have
shared was won without them! <i>No man having put
his hand to the plough</i> (or, to the sword), <i>and looking
back, is fit for the kingdom of heaven.</i></p>

<p>The force under Gideon had now dwindled from
thirty-two thousand to ten thousand men. Human
wisdom would have deemed these all too few to oppose
the multitudes of Midian encamped in the valley before
them; but not so judged the God of hosts. The Lord
said unto Gideon, “The people are yet too many; bring
them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee
there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee;
and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go
with thee, the same shall not go.”</p>

<p>Gideon, in obedience to the command, brought down
his forces unto the water, leaving the selection of the
chosen band of heroes unto Him who readeth the thoughts
of the heart. Doubtless the Israelites were thirsty from
their long march in the heat of that sultry clime; by
far the greater number threw themselves on their knees
by the water, stooping down eagerly to drink; three
hundred only lapped from their hands the cooling draught.
And the Lord said unto Gideon, “By the three hundred
men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites
into thine hand; and let all the other people go
every man unto his place.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus14.jpg" width="500" height="525" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GIDEON’S ARMY DRINKING AT THE BROOK.</p>
</div>

<p>Mysterious command, and yet was it instantly obeyed.
Gideon dismissed the greater part of his forces, not to
their homes, but to their tents. They had yet their
appointed part to take; they would complete the
victory; they would follow up the pursuit. It is not
given to all to be foremost in peril or in fame. Some
are called to do great things, to suffer great things for
God; others have a humbler part to perform: they have
to follow up the successes of their brethren; not to shine
conspicuously as Christian heroes, but to do their duty
steadily as Christian men. It is very possible that some
bold spirits amongst Gideon’s ten thousand may have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
been tempted to repine at being excluded from the
glorious privilege of those who were to bear the brunt,
and win the highest renown. And now the zealous
servant of Christ, kept back by sickness or some other
dispensation from active usefulness for his Lord, finds it
hard to realize the truth, “They also serve who only
stand and wait.” He fain would be in the scene of
action; he fain would join in the glorious strife. Must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
he look on while others labour? must he stand still
while others fight? My brethren, the place which our
great Leader assigns to us is the right place, however
humbling it may be to our pride. The submission of
those who retired to their tents may have been as
acceptable to God as the courage of those who remained
to perform the perilous duty before them.</p>

<p>The truth which is especially brought to our notice
in this remarkable portion of the story of Gideon, is the
necessity that God should be given the glory of every
high and holy work which He enables His people to
perform. Israel was not to say, “Mine own hand hath
saved me.” Weak instruments were purposely chosen,
that the honour of success might pertain unto God, and
not man. And how often has the same lesson been
taught in the history of the Church! Not the mighty,
not the noble or the learned were appointed at the first
to proclaim the gospel of salvation. When the lowly
and illiterate, when fishermen from Galilee were chosen
as leaders of the hosts of the Lord, who could not but
own that their success was due to the power of the
Spirit? It is right that we should employ all lawful
means to further God’s work, but let us beware that
we rest not in means; let us especially beware that we
use no means that are not sanctified by His blessing.
Had the ten thousand valiant men been led forward by
Gideon against the foe, what would their number, what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
would their courage, what would their zeal have availed?
Doubtless shameful defeat would have followed presumptuous
self-confidence, and he who had rested on an
arm of flesh have found that he had leaned on a broken
reed.</p>

<p>Christians are now not unfrequently placed in a position
which may remind us of that of Gideon, when he
found his forces melting away in the face of a formidable
foe. In the midst of active labours for God, one is
smitten down by sickness, his work is still to be done—the
power to do it seems taken away. Another, active
in works of charity, suddenly loses the means of which
he has made such liberal use, his resources dwindle like
the army of Gideon, and he is tempted to cry, “O Lord,
wherefore hast Thou crippled my usefulness? what I
had, was it not devoted to Thy service?” My brethren,
if the blessing of God be left behind, we may rest trustfully
in the assurance that He will care for His own
work. He can make a few victorious over the many.
His blessing on a cruse of oil and a handful of meal
made them a surer source of supply than the granaries
of the wealthy. God hath not forsaken, He would only
humble and prove His servants, and teach them through
trials of faith to look for success only to Him.</p>

<p>Were it not for our past experience that flowers must
fade to make way for fruit, how sad would be the sight
of the fading blossoms on a tree—the petals strewed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
the dust, their brilliant beauty departed! But we know
that what is more precious is left behind; that on the
bough remains the green germ of the fruit which shall
renew the beauty of the tree, and give to it a value
beyond what it possessed in the smiling days of spring.
So see we faith in trial. Outward advantages may be
taken away, sweet hopes may fall and wither, but if the
fruit-tree be thriving and deep-rooted, harvest glory is
yet to come. Job—stripped of property, children,
health—might lament the day of his birth, and believe
that his season of active usefulness was departed for
ever; but through his very trials and losses he passed to
greater glory and joy, and has become a fruitful source
of blessing to the Church of God through many generations.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I am sure that Mr. Eardley was thinking of Mr.
Arthur Madden this evening when he spoke of
active labourers for God being smitten down by
sickness,” observed Rebekah Holdich to her
husband, after the little congregation had dispersed
from the cottage.</p>

<p>“Mr. Arthur—I hope there’s nothing the matter with
him!” said Holdich, with a look of concern on his manly
countenance. “The last news was that he had been
ordained at Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>“But I grieve to say that worse tidings came this
morning to Mr. Eardley in a letter from Mr. Arthur’s
youngest sister, who has been nursing him in a dangerous
illness. The doctors say that the climate does not
agree with his health; he was ordered to England
directly—he and his sister were to start by the very
next steamer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>“It will be a real pleasure to see them again,” observed
Holdich. He was a man rather of deeds than
words, so the simple sentence expressed a great deal
more than it would have done from the lips of another.</p>

<p>“But Mr. Arthur may never arrive, he may sink by
the way,” faltered Rebekah, who was of a disposition
naturally tender, and not very hopeful.</p>

<p>“Wife, he is in God’s hands,” said Holdich; “sick or
well, on sea or on land—he will be given what is best
for him.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” thought Rebekah, “my husband is always one
to see behind the fading blossoms the germ of the fruit.
His is a faith that can bear wind and storm; he can
trust not only himself, but (what I find so much harder
to do) those whom he loves, to his God.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bolder, as usual, carried back to her suffering
husband an account of the cottage-lecture.</p>

<p>“There’s a word of comfort for me,” observed Bolder;
“maybe I’m like one of these nine thousand seven hundred
Israelites sent back to their tents. They were not to
be trusted to gain the victory, lest they should boast that
their own strength had won it. God kept them in the
background to keep them humble; but they were not rejected—no!
Nor is many a poor sinner like me, though
shut up from active work—we shall yet be allowed to
join in the shout, <i>Thanks be to God who giveth us the
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>Lottie Stone had returned to the Lodge that evening
with a very heavy heart. Her mind was far less occupied
with the lecture than with the tidings which she
had heard of the dangerous illness of one of her earliest
benefactors. Already perplexed and distressed as she
was on account of her father, this new trouble had come
on the little maid as a shock. The words in which Mrs.
Bolder had communicated the news to her, “Have you
heard that Mr. Arthur Madden is dying at Jerusalem?”
had struck like a knell on her heart. Already that
young tender heart was bleeding from home anxieties
and troubles of which Lottie could not speak even to
the kind mistress for whose counsel and sympathy she
yearned, and now this second blow seemed almost crushing.
Her father in difficulties, out of which she could
not help him, returning after the absence of years to his
country, but sick, tied down by debt, unable to reach
those who loved him; and now the generous friend of
the family dying in a far-distant land—thoughts of all
this were a most oppressive burden of sorrow to Lottie.
Her mind was so full of its troubles that she was more
than usually awkward and inattentive in service. She
was unpunctual in bringing in tea, the milk-jug was
empty, the plates forgotten, the water had never been
boiling. Isa was a little displeased, Mr. Gritton was
angry, and his peevish chiding increased the confusion of
poor Lottie Stone. In her nervous haste in removing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
the tea-tray she knocked over a letter-weigher which
had lain upon Gaspar’s table. It fell with a clatter
which made the invalid start, and the various weights
were scattered hither and thither, some on the boards,
some on the piece of brown drugget which covered the
centre of the apartment.</p>

<p>“The girl must have been drinking!” exclaimed Gaspar
angrily, while poor Lottie went down on her knees
to gather up the weights. Isa, pitying her confusion,
said, in order to draw away the attention of Gaspar, “I
have not yet told you of Edith’s kindness; she has promised
to send my poor consumptive girl to Bournemouth.”</p>

<p>“I feel no interest in the matter,” replied Mr. Gritton;
“I wish that, instead of hunting up cases outside the
house, you would manage to keep a little better order
within it.”</p>

<p>Lottie rose from her knees after her search, and
timidly placed the weigher on the mantel-piece. She
had recovered all the weights belonging to it but one,
the smallest of the set, and that, in the dim light thrown
by the solitary candle on the table, she had not been
able to find. Lottie was nervously afraid lest her
master should examine the small machine and find it
imperfect.</p>

<p>“I will hunt for the little round thing in the morning,
when no one is watching me,” thought Lottie, “and I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
never rest then till I find it.” The letter-weigher was
the only elegant article which Gaspar’s study contained;
it had been a birth-day gift from his sister, and had
particularly attracted the admiration of Lottie, who, in
her simplicity, had taken the gilded ornament for gold.
The loss of the little weight was to the young maid a
sensible addition to her heavier troubles.</p>

<p>“If I can’t find that little gold bit, what on earth
shall I do?” thought Lottie, with the fear before her
mind of having to replace an article of value unknown;
“I dare say that it is worth half a sovereign, and master
may say that the whole thing is spoiled by its loss.
How shall I ever pay for it out of my wages, and just
at a time when I would do anything to win more money
for father? I’ll get up early, so early to-morrow, and
search every cranny in that room before any one else is
about in the house.”</p>

<p>Lottie Stone could hardly sleep that night from the
many anxious thoughts which haunted her brain. She
arose before dawn to hunt for the weight, crept out of
her little chamber, and softly descended the stairs to the
study. She opened the shutters, but the stars were
glimmering yet in the deep blue sky, there was not
sufficient light for her need. Lottie lighted a candle
and began her search, under the table, the chairs, the
fender, in every likely and unlikely place she hunted,
but “the little gold bit” was not to be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll move the table right to the wall, and pull up
the drugget, maybe it has rolled under there,” said
Lottie to herself, exerting all her strength to move the
deal table, with Gaspar’s heavy desk upon it, to the
other side of the room.</p>

<p>To draw up the drugget was an easier task, and
scarcely had it been removed when, stuck between two
of the boards which had been covered by the cloth,
Lottie to her great relief caught sight of the bright little
weight.</p>

<p>She ran up to the spot, and tried to pick up the
weight, but a foot had trodden on it and pressed it in
firmly. Lottie pulled harder, and to her extreme surprise
found that in moving the weight she also moved
one of the planks between which it was jammed, while
a previously imperceptible line crossed the breadth of
three of them. Accident had discovered to Lottie a
most carefully concealed trap-door in the floor, in the
spot which was usually covered both by the drugget and
the table. With some little trouble Lottie managed to
raise it, and with wondering curiosity she peered down,
still on her knees, into the dark vault below, into which
there was a means of descent by a ladder. Stories that
had been current in the hamlet then recurred to the
mind of Lottie, stories of the caution and mystery used
in the building of Wildwaste Lodge. She had never
heard that there were cellars beneath it, and a concealed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
trap-door would be a strange kind of opening into one
intended to contain only wine. As Lottie bent over the
dark recess, candle in hand, the little gilded weight
which she had recovered slipped from her hold, and fell
down into the vault below. It was needful again to
search for it, and perhaps the young girl was not sorry
for an excuse to explore a little further. Slowly and
softly Lottie descended the ladder, carrying the candle
in her hand. When she had reached the bottom, she
found herself in a brick-built vault; the air felt damp
and chill, moisture stains gleamed faintly on the walls.
On the further side was a door, close to which the little
weight had rolled. Lottie went and picked it up, and
then pressed her hand against the door; it was not
locked, but slightly ajar, and yielded to her pressure.
Lottie could not resist the temptation of entering the
inner vault. It had brick walls and floor like the first,
but was not, like the first, perfectly empty. There were
low shelves, on which was ranged all the family plate
which Mr. Gritton had inherited from his father, silver
candlesticks, salvers, and tureens, with curious old coins
in cases, all looking dull and tarnished. There were
also yellow canvas bags ranged in order. Lottie put
down her candle, and, by a strong impulse of curiosity,
raised one: it was very heavy in proportion to its size;
she loosened the string round the mouth and glanced in—it
was full of golden sovereigns! The black eyes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
Lottie dilated—she could scarcely breathe—the hand
which held the canvas bag trembled. The foolish young
daughter of Eve had by her indiscreet curiosity put herself
into a position of sore temptation, she had given the
Enemy an advantage; he who had dared to breathe his
deadly whisper in Eden, was present to tempt in that
dark deep vault.</p>

<p>“What a world of wealth is buried here, wealth useless
to its owner, useless to all the world! A few yellow
pieces from one of those canvas bags would never be
missed, while they would bring help to a long-lost father,
bring him back to his home, fill the heart of a mother
with delight.” Nay, even the impious suggestion followed:
“This discovery has not been made by chance.
Providence has guided you here to give you the means
of helping your parents in the time of their greatest
need.”</p>

<p>Well was it then for the tempted girl that prayer had
become so habitual that she intuitively turned to her
God for guidance, as a child might turn to a parent.
Then her pastor’s words recurred to her memory, “Let
us especially beware that we use no means that are not
sanctified by God’s blessing.” It was Lottie’s duty, indeed,
to make every effort for her parents, but God’s
work must be only done in God’s way. His blessing
could not rest on ill-gotten gold, and without that blessing
what could come but misery and shame? Lottie’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
faith was in trial; she was called on to abstain from
following the only course by which it seemed possible
for her to rescue her father. It was not by low covetousness,
but by the strong warm affections of the heart
that the Tempter was seeking to draw the simple child
into guilt. It was a short, a painful struggle, and then
faith rose victorious. “Oh, no! how can I do this
thing, and sin against God!” exclaimed Lottie aloud,
and not trusting herself to look again at the bags of
treasure, she turned suddenly round—and confronted
her master!</p>

<p>Lottie started violently at the unexpected meeting
with Gaspar; she then stood as if spell-bound, with her
black eyes rivetted on his; she seemed to have no power
to withdraw them, no power to utter another word. The
sight of Mr. Gritton’s sallow, shrunken countenance,
looking to her corpse-like in that dimly-lighted vault,
exercised on the girl a kind of fascination, such as that
which is attributed to the serpent’s gaze.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus15.jpg" width="500" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.</p>
</div>

<p>Gaspar had been roused from sleep by the sounds
made by Lottie in the search for the gilded weight. He
never enjoyed the deep refreshing slumber of a mind at
rest; the miser was haunted by the fears that are
natural to one whose treasure is on earth, where thieves
may break through and steal. Alarmed by the noise
which he heard at an hour so unusually early, Gaspar
had risen and partially dressed, his anxiety being increased<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
by the recollection that he had forgotten to lock
the door of the inner vault when last he had visited it,
as he frequently did, in the night-time. It was an infirmity
of Gaspar, perhaps originating in the shock
caused to him by the loss of the <i>Orissa</i>, to feel that his
money was never so safe as when immediately under his
eye; it was a satisfaction to the slave of Mammon to
sleep over his buried treasure. Mr. Gritton was, however,
nervously sensitive to the danger of keeping large
sums of money in an unguarded dwelling, especially in
such a lawless neighbourhood as that of Wildwaste. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
must hide from all the knowledge of the existence of
hoards which would tempt the burglar. With this view
Gaspar had caused vaults to be constructed with a
special view to concealment: no one in Wildwaste knew
of their existence. Mr. Gritton did what he could to
appear before men as a gentleman of very narrow means;
and though he had not succeeded in this, he had until
now perfectly preserved the secret of a treasure kept
under his house.</p>

<p>It was with annoyance and alarm that Gaspar now
found his secret discovered. He could not doubt the
honesty of Lottie, whose words he had just overheard;
he was relieved to find that his vault had been entered
by no more formidable intruder; but he anxiously revolved
the means of preventing the discovery from
spreading further, and stood sternly regarding the trembling
girl for what appeared to her a fearfully long time.</p>

<p>“You have taken nothing?” he asked at length; to
Lottie his voice sounded hollow and terrible, breaking
the painful silence.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir—you can search me—I never thought—;”
the girl checked herself in the midst of her sentence—“no,
I mustn’t say that, for I was tempted; but it was
for my father.”</p>

<p>“I never heard that you had a father living,” said
Gaspar.</p>

<p>“He is living, and in great distress, at Southampton.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>“Hear me, girl,” said the master sternly. “I
believe—I know that you are honest, but I have no
means of knowing that you are discreet; after what has
happened I cannot suffer you to stay for one hour longer
in this house.” Seeing that Lottie looked aghast at this
summary dismissal, Gaspar added more gently, “I am
going to exact from you a most solemn promise that you
will never utter to any being a word of what you have
seen this day, or of the cause of your being thus hastily
dismissed from my service.”</p>

<p>“I must tell my mother,” faltered Lottie, “or she
will think that I have done something wrong; I never
hide nothing from her.”</p>

<p>“You must not tell your mother, nor your lady, nor
any one,” said Gaspar. “I will make it worth your
while to keep silence.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that I could keep it,” said poor
Lottie.</p>

<p>Mr. Gritton laid his hand on one of the canvas bags,
unloosed it, and took out five pieces of gold. “See here,
Lottie Stone,” he said sternly; “if you will not make a
solemn promise to tell no one, I will at once give you
up to justice as a person found lurking, at a strange
hour and under suspicious circumstances, in a place
where treasure is kept.” He marked that Lottie’s rosy
cheek blanched at the threat, and went on, “If you will
pledge yourself to the strictest secrecy, you shall take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
home these five golden sovereigns; and if in the course
of a year I find that nothing has transpired either of the
cause of your leaving, or of the existence of these vaults,
I will give you five sovereigns more.”</p>

<p>A flash of joy beamed on the countenance of Lottie.
So intense was her desire to possess the very sum which
her master offered to place in her hands, that to obtain
it she would have been ready to sacrifice anything but
her conscience.</p>

<p>“O sir!” she exclaimed, “I will—I do promise. I
will never say one word about this place, or what I have
seen, or why you send me away—I will rather die than
speak!”</p>

<p>“You promise before God?” said Gaspar solemnly,
before he placed the money in the hand of the excited
girl.</p>

<p>“I do, I do!” exclaimed Lottie, and her fingers
closed over the gold. She felt that she had saved her
father.</p>

<p>“Now go up, pack your bundle, and be off,” said
Gaspar; “and never set foot in Wildwaste again; and
remember that guilt lies on your soul if you keep not
your promise to the letter.”</p>

<p>“May I not stay till I can bid good-bye to dear Miss
Isa?” pleaded Lottie.</p>

<p>“You may not stay an hour; I do not choose that
you should see her; take your money and your clothes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
and be gone. Leave the candle; I will stay behind to
make sure that all is right—and to lock the door,” added
Gritton, under his breath; “I will not neglect that precaution
again.”</p>

<p>Lottie, tightly grasping her dearly-won treasure,
mounted the ladder, and re-entered the study through
the trap-door. She hastily replaced the little weight on
its gilded stand, and then ran upstairs to make her brief
preparations for quitting Wildwaste for ever. Lottie
soon put up her bundle, for her earthly possessions were
few, and with it in her hand descended the staircase.
Tears gushed from her eyes as she reached the door of
Isa’s chamber; Lottie could not help lingering there for
a minute to breathe a prayer for the young mistress so
dearly beloved. “Oh! shall I never serve her again,
never listen to her sweet kind voice, never comb out her
long soft hair! What will she say of me, what will she
think of me—will she not call me the most ungrateful
girl in the world?” Lottie’s heart swelled at the idea,
and it was with a low stifled sob that she turned away
from the door.</p>

<p>She found her master in the hall, himself unfastening
the bolts of the outer door. Mr. Gritton was impatient
to have the girl out of the house, and beyond the temptation
of communicating with any one in the hamlet.</p>

<p>“Your father is in Southampton—you had better
join him there,” observed Gaspar. “Remember your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
solemn promise of silence made in the sight of
Heaven.”</p>

<p>Lottie turned as she crossed the threshold, “O sir—pray—at
least—let my dear mistress know that—”</p>

<p>Gaspar would not listen, he closed the door in her
face, and Lottie found herself alone with her bundle and
her gold in the chill crisp air of early morning. A dim
line of red in the east showed where the sun would
shortly rise, but as Lottie hastened through the hamlet
there was not the sound of a human voice to break the
stillness; Wildwaste was still asleep; in the great manufactory
the busy hum of labour had not yet begun. But
on the common, where the night dews lay heavy on
fern and furze-bush, the lark, an early riser, was already
mounting on quivering wing, and pouring out his song
of joy to greet the advancing morn.</p>

<h3>SUSPICIONS.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-l.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Lottie had proceeded more than half of her way
to Axe before her mind could realize her strange
position, and the difficulties in which it must
involve her. Her first thought had been of her
father, her next of her young mistress; but
every step that Lottie now took seemed to open to her
a new complication of troubles. She had lost her place,
and how could she expect to find a new one while she
was utterly unable to explain why she had so suddenly
left the last? What should she say to Mr. Eardley,
who had taken such fatherly care to provide for her
welfare? Poor Lottie became so utterly perplexed by
her troubles, her first secret weighed on her frank honest
nature as such an intolerable chain, that she could hardly
think of physical weariness or discomfort, though the
distance to Axe was long to be traversed by a fasting
girl; and ere Lottie came in sight of the quaint little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
town, a shower which wet her clothes through and
through.</p>

<p>The world was beginning to show signs of being astir
as Lottie entered the High Street of Axe; tradesmen’s
boys were taking down their shutters, the milkmaid was
passing with her pails; the rain had ceased, and the
clear morning sun was gleaming on the windows of
the houses.</p>

<p>“Why, Lottie Stone, what ever brings you here at
this ’ere hour of the day?” exclaimed Mrs. Green, the
cobbler’s stout wife, over whose little shop Deborah had
her lodging.</p>

<p>Lottie muttered something, she knew not what, as she
hurried through the shop. She ran up the steep dark
staircase, and entered the room of her mother, whom she
found in bonnet and shawl, with an old carpet-bag in
her hand, as if about to set out on a journey. Deborah
started at the unexpected entrance of her daughter, all
wet with the rain, and flushed with excitement and the
fatigue of a long, weary walk.</p>

<p>“O mother, here, here’s for father!” exclaimed
Lottie, eagerly holding out the five sovereigns which Mr.
Gritton had given her.</p>

<p>“It is from God!” cried Deborah; “He has sent it—praise
be to His goodness! Lottie, I’ve scarce a
minute to tell you of it, for I must be off to catch the
train, but I’m a-going to Southampton myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>“To Southampton!” echoed Lottie in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes; there was another letter yesterday, not from
my poor Abner, but from his landlord: your father’s
worse again—very ill; I’ve been a-borrowing, and begging,
and scraping, and I’ve just got money enough for
the journey; but these here five pounds have come as a
blessing from Heaven! Mrs. Green has promised to do
the ironing, and to tidy up things while I’m away—”</p>

<p>“She need do nothing; I’m here, I’ve left my place,”
said Lottie.</p>

<p>“Left your place!” exclaimed Deborah, dropping
on the table the five gold pieces which her daughter had
brought.</p>

<p>“Left your place!” repeated Mrs. Green, who had
followed Lottie up the stairs, and who now turned a very
inquisitive look on the money which had so unexpectedly
and unaccountably been added to her neighbour’s little
store.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stone had no time for questioning, though Lottie’s
few words had laid a fresh burden of care on her grief-worn
spirit. On Mrs. Green’s informing her that “she’d
better be off sharp, or she’d miss the train,” Deborah
caught up her money and her carpet-bag, bade a hurried
good-bye to her daughter and her son, and hastened off
to the station. Mrs. Green remained in the little room,
determined, as she said to herself, “to get to the bottom
of the business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>“I say, Lottie,” she observed to the weary girl, who
was taking off her wet bonnet and cloak, “was it you as
brought them ’ere sovereigns to your mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the unsuspicious Lottie, wishing heartily
that the stout landlady would go and leave her to rest
and collect her thoughts.</p>

<p>“You’ve hardly earned ’em yet as wages, I take it.”
The shrewd, sharp, questioning look of the woman put
the young girl on her guard.</p>

<p>“How did you manage to get them, eh?” pursued
Mrs. Green, peering into the face of Lottie with an expression
of suspicion which covered that face in a moment
with a scarlet flush of indignation.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you—what is it to you?—I got them
honestly, you may be sure of that,” stammered forth
Lottie, as she pushed back the black hair from her heated
cheeks.</p>

<p>“Did your master give ’em to you? he’s not the kind
of man for that sort of thing, or the world does him injustice.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Green, would you be so kind as to leave us for
a little,” said Lottie desperately; “I am very, very, very
tired, and—;” she knew not how to finish her sentence.</p>

<p>The cobbler’s wife did not seem in the least inclined to
go. She shook her head gravely, looked hard at the girl,
and then shook her head again. “Better be open at
once, Lottie Stone, you know I’m your friend; I know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
all about your father, poor man! If you’ve been a
bit tempted, and—”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus16.jpg" width="500" height="575" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LOTTIE AND MRS. GREEN.</p>
</div>

<p>“The money is honestly mine—every penny of it—how
dare you say such things?” exclaimed the indignant
girl.</p>

<p>“Well, then, you’ve only to tell the simple truth how
you came by it; there’s nothing to flare up about,” said
Mrs. Green, putting her stout arms akimbo.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to tell nothing; I want to be left
quiet,” cried Lottie, who felt much inclined to burst into
a passion of tears; while her simple brother looked on in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
surprise, rubbing his shock of hair, as he was wont to do
when perplexed.</p>

<p>A third time Mrs. Green shook her head; solemnly,
ominously she shook it. “Well,” she muttered, “if girls
will behave like that, after all the schooling, and praying,
and preaching, and—;” the rest of the observation was
unheard by the Stones, as their landlady had left the
room as she uttered it, slamming the door behind her.
Lottie knew by her manner that the cobbler’s wife was
offended; and was convinced that within an hour the
story of the five sovereigns would be spread all over Axe,
as was already that of Abner’s arrival at Southampton,
Deborah, in her efforts to procure money for her journey,
having found it impossible to obey her husband’s injunction
of secrecy.</p>

<p>“Lottie, how <i>did</i> you get all that money?” asked
her brother, as soon as Mrs. Green’s heavy clumping step
was heard descending the stair.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you be a-worritting me too, Steady!” exclaimed
Lottie, calling the lad by a name which Arthur
Madden had given to him in the class, and which had
clung to him, from its appropriateness, till it had almost
superseded his own.</p>

<p>Steady was not wont to “worrit” any one, and least
of all the sister to whose brighter intelligence he had
habitually looked up through his clouded boyhood, and
whom he heartily loved. He was easily silenced, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
not easily relieved. He sat down by the casement
to his usual occupation of cutting pegs, but ever
and anon a heavy sigh came from the poor youth’s
breast.</p>

<p>“You’re troubled about father?” asked Lottie, who
was laying out the rough-dried linen which she was about
to iron for her mother.</p>

<p>“I warn’t a-thinking of father, but of that money,”
replied the lad, in his slow, measured drawl: he had
difficulty in putting even the most simple thought into
words.</p>

<p>“Steady, surely <i>you</i> know me, <i>you</i> can trust me!”
cried Lottie, with a swelling heart.</p>

<p>“I does trust you,” said the lad emphatically, “but
other folk won’t;” and with another sigh he relapsed
into silence.</p>

<p>Very sadly Lottie pursued her occupation of ironing.
“Oh,” thought she, “I wish that I could smooth away
all these difficulties, as I press down the creases out of
this linen! Father ill—Mr. Arthur dying—mother
away—and then this dreadful, dreadful promise! Oh,
that I never had made it!”</p>

<p>“Here’s Mr. Eardley a-coming,” said young Stone,
looking out of the window.</p>

<p>For the first time the sound of her pastor’s name was
unwelcome to Lottie, for the first time in her life she
dreaded an interview with the clergyman. What could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
she say to him, how explain to him what must appear so
mysterious and strange?</p>

<p>Mr. Eardley crossed the road, and did not, as Lottie
earnestly hoped, pass the door of the cobbler’s shop. She
heard his foot on the stair, his tap at the door of the
room. Lottie laid down her iron, courtesied on the
entrance of the clergyman, and remained with her eyes
fixed on the ground, her fingers nervously twitching the
linen which lay on the table beside her. She was not
sufficiently collected to think of offering her pastor a
chair.</p>

<p>“Lottie, I am sorry to hear that you have left your
place,” said Mr. Eardley. “You seemed to be so happy
and contented when I spoke to you last Sunday, that
I hoped that you would remain for many years at the
Lodge, and become in time a valuable servant.” Mr.
Eardley’s address was fatherly and kind, but Lottie’s only
reply was in the big tears which rolled slowly down her
flushed cheeks.</p>

<p>“Come, my child, speak frankly to one who has your
true welfare at heart. Did you displease your lady? or
had you some little difference with your fellow-servant?”</p>

<p>Mr. Eardley paused for an answer, but no answer came.</p>

<p>“O Lottie, speak out!” cried her brother, who had
a child-like faith in the wisdom as well as the kindness
of their pastor.</p>

<p>Mr. Eardley was both perplexed and distressed by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
strange reserve shown by one whose disposition he had
hitherto found clear as daylight. He had heard in an
exaggerated form the story of the money which Lottie
had brought from Wildwaste, and very painful suspicions
began to arise in his mind. Yet the clergyman shrank
at first from saying a word that might appear like a
charge of dishonesty against one whose character had
hitherto been without a stain.</p>

<p>“What did your lady say to your leaving her?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” was trembling upon the lips of the girl,
but Lottie pressed them together, and kept silent. She
was aware that if by answering questions she were led
into telling anything, she would gradually be drawn into
telling all; it was only by preserving silence that she
could possibly preserve the secret which she had solemnly
promised to keep.</p>

<p>“Lottie, why don’t you speak?” cried Steady in real
distress.</p>

<p>“Miss Gritton appears to be so gentle and kind,”
pursued the clergyman.</p>

<p>“She’s an angel! I’d die for her!” interrupted Lottie,
fairly breaking down, and bursting into a fit of loud
sobbing.</p>

<p>“Do you not think that, if you have displeased her,
she might be persuaded to overlook a fault, and take you
back?” suggested Mr. Eardley, glad that at least the
girl’s obstinate silence was broken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>“I can’t go back!” sobbed Lottie.</p>

<p>“And wherefore not?” inquired Mr. Eardley.</p>

<p>“Lottie, do, do speak,” pleaded her brother.</p>

<p>The poor girl was in bitter distress. A false idea of
honour has led many a duellist to face the fire of an
enemy, but never did the most nervous spirit more
shrink from such an ordeal than did that of the little
servant-maid from that which she now had to pass
through. Influenced by the highest sense of honour—conscientious
respect for a promise—Lottie stood the
mark of questions, each of which seemed to strike her in
the tenderest part. She had more than filial reverence
for her pastor: to stand well in his favour, to do credit
to his care, had been one of the highest objects of her
ambition; to grieve, displease, disappoint him, was misery
to which she could hardly have believed it possible that
she should ever be exposed. Mr. Eardley, on his part,
found the interview very painful. He had regarded
Lottie Stone as one of the most promising girls under his
pastoral charge; she was so simple-minded, affectionate,
and pious; he could have trusted her with money uncounted;
were she to prove ungrateful and unworthy, in
whom could he henceforth trust? The clergyman was
very patient and tender, but he was also very faithful.
For more than an hour he stood in that little room,
plying the silent, miserable girl with questions that put
her to the torture, appealing to her reason, her affections,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
her conscience; exhorting, reproving, entreating—doing
all that lay in his power to overcome her inexplicable
reserve. Mr Eardley saw that Lottie’s character, that
most precious of earthly possessions, was at stake; that
if she continued silent, a merciless world would believe
the worst. He explained this again and again; and
Lottie, in anguish of soul, felt how true was every word
which he uttered. And yet, had she not promised before
God? was it not better to endure suspicions than to
incur sin? Not all the efforts of her pastor, backed by
the entreaties of her simple-hearted brother, could force
the poor girl from the position to which conscience had
fastened her, like a baited creature fixed to the stake.</p>

<p>At length, disappointed and disheartened, Mr. Eardley
took his leave, promising, however, soon to return.
Lottie wrung her hands in silent misery as she heard
the door close behind him. “There,” she thought, “goes
the kindest, most generous of friends, wearied out at last,
and thinking me an ungrateful and wicked girl. Oh,
I could have borne anything better than this!”</p>

<p>Lottie was not to have even a breathing-space of
relief. Not five minutes after the departure of Mr.
Eardley, the baronet’s carriage drove up to the door of
the cobbler’s shop, with Isa and her cousin within. Its
approach was announced to Lottie by her brother’s exclamation,
“Here comes your mistress a-looking arter
ye now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>“I think all this will drive me mad!” cried Lottie,
pressing both her hands to her burning temples.</p>

<p>Isa had been much surprised, and even alarmed, on
being informed by Hannah at an early hour that
morning that “that there girl Lottie” had “run away
without saying a word to nobody; taken her bundle,
and gone clean off.” Isa could in no way account for
the sudden departure of her young servant, except by
imagining that she had taken offence at something, and
that perhaps something wild and gipsy-like in her nature
corresponded with her somewhat gipsy-like appearance.</p>

<p>“To go without saying a word to me, kind and indulgent
as I ever have been, seems so strange, so ungrateful,”
observed Isa to her brother, when she mentioned
to him at breakfast a fact of which he had had
much earlier notice than herself.</p>

<p>“No accounting for the vagaries of a raw, untutored
village rustic,” observed Gaspar, applying to his snuff-box;
and he was ungenerous enough to add, in order to cover
his own confusion, “You had better count up the
spoons.”</p>

<p>“I could answer for Lottie’s honesty,” said Isa.</p>

<p>So could Gaspar Gritton, for he had seen it put to the
proof; he had seen the “raw, untutored village rustic”
withstand a temptation under which he, an educated man,
calling himself a gentleman, had basely succumbed. But
Gaspar felt himself placed in a position of difficulty.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
He would probably have at once told his sister all the
circumstances connected with Lottie’s dismissal, had it
not been for Isa’s having spoken to him on the subject
of the <i>Orissa</i>. Gaspar shrank from avowing to one who,
as he knew, suspected <i>his</i> honesty, that he actually had
a large sum of money concealed in a vault.</p>

<p>“What could have induced the girl to take such a step?”
said Isa, following the current of her own thoughts.
“Hannah is as much in the dark as ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Really,” observed Gaspar peevishly, “the subject is
not worth the trouble of considering. Such an insignificant
cipher may go, or stay, or hang herself; it matters
not the turn of a straw to us.”</p>

<p>A feeling of indignation swelled the heart of Isa, and
it cost her an effort to give it no outward expression.
Isa was not one of those who regard the humbler
members of a household as mere pieces of furniture, to
be discarded when faulty, or neglected when worn out,
without a thought or a care. She looked upon them as
fellow-Christians and fellow-immortals, over whom the
position of master or mistress gives an influence for
which an account must one day be rendered. Added to
this, Lottie’s simplicity, warmth of heart, and the knowledge
of her early trials, had engaged in her behalf the
kindly interest of her young mistress. Isa’s anxiety on
account of her run-away servant was not only a matter
of conscience, but a matter of feeling also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>After some minutes of silence, Isa exclaimed, as if she
had suddenly found a clue for which she had been
searching, “It must have been your words to her yesterday
evening.”</p>

<p>“What words do you mean?” asked Gaspar.</p>

<p>“You said that she must have been drinking. Such
a sentence, though lightly spoken, would wound her
deeply, for she would think it an allusion to the well-known
vice of her father, whom, poor child, she loves so
dearly.”</p>

<p>“Really,” observed Mr. Gritton, with a short, harsh
laugh, “we must be careful now-a-days where we blow
thistle-down, lest it should wound some sensitive maid-of-all-work!”
He was not sorry that Isa should suggest
some cause for Lottie’s sudden flight that was remote
from the real one.</p>

<p>“I cannot rest till I know all, and have seen the
poor girl,” thought Isa; “I will go over to the Castle at
once, and ask Edith to take me in the carriage to Axe.”</p>

<h3>EVIL TONGUES.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I will not go in with you, Isa dear,” said Edith,
as the carriage approached the little country
town. “Lottie will speak to you more freely
if no one is by. I hope that we shall be able
to carry back with us to Wildwaste your runaway
little gipsy maid.”</p>

<p>“I am sure that we shall,” replied Isa. “Lottie is an
affectionate girl, and loves me. I must chide her a little,
but gently; she is one with whom a short reproof will
go a long way.”</p>

<p>“And all your scourges are made of feathers, like
those in the fairy-tale,” said Edith with a smile, as the
carriage rolled up to the door of Mrs. Green’s shop.</p>

<p>Courteously declining the guidance of the cobbler’s
stout wife, Isa lightly ascended the stair to the lodging
above. She entertained not the slightest doubt of succeeding
in bringing back her truant; her only subject of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
consideration was how far reproof should be blended
with kindness. Lottie’s strange conduct had given her
mistress just cause of offence; it must not be overlooked,
though in Isa’s heart it was already forgiven.</p>

<p>The lady tapped at the door, and entered the room
where Lottie stood trembling. Her face was buried in
her hands; but Isa could see the red burning flush on
her neck. The girl’s attitude was so expressive of
humiliation and grief, that her gentle mistress forgot at
once all her intended rebuke.</p>

<p>“My poor Lottie, what has happened?” There was
nothing but kindness and sympathy in the voice which
uttered the question.</p>

<p>The tears trickled through Lottie’s brown fingers;
but she did not remove her hands or raise her head.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” repeated Isa, addressing
herself to the lad, who had risen from his seat on the
entrance of the lady.</p>

<p>Steady tugged hard at the button of his jacket; his
nostrils dilated; he looked first to one side and then to
the other, an image of dull perplexity. He jerked out
the answer, “She won’t tell no one;” and then, unable
to bear another interview like that which had just passed
between his sister and Mr. Eardley, the poor lad shuffled
hastily out of the room.</p>

<p>Isa went up to Lottie Stone, and gently laid her hand
on her shoulder. “If you have had anything to pain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
and distress you, open your heart to me. I am not
angry with you, Lottie, though you did wrong to leave
the house without giving notice. I am willing to take
you back if you tell me frankly the cause of your
going.”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell,” replied Lottie in a choking voice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus17.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MISS ISA QUESTIONS LOTTIE.</p>
</div>

<p>“Something that was said distressed you, perhaps.
Was it what your master spoke about drinking, when
you threw down the weights last evening?”</p>

<p>Isa’s question suddenly opened for the young maid a
little door of escape. The lady had found out a cause<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
for Lottie’s strange conduct when she herself could give
none. Would there be any harm in leaving Miss
Gritton to think, and to lead others to think, that the
whole strange affair had arisen from a burst of passionate
feeling, caused by an accusation which had been both
unjust and cruel? A disingenuous girl would have
gladly availed herself of the lady’s mistaken view, and
have left her to form her own conclusions from it. But
Lottie had the straightforward simplicity of one in whose
spirit there is no guile. She shook her head on Isa’s
repeating her question, and her mistress remained more
perplexed than ever. Isa felt, as Mr. Eardley had felt,
surprised, discouraged, and at length a little displeased.
Lottie would neither apologize, nor explain, nor consent
to go back to her place. No sentence could be wrung
from her lips but a repetition of “I can’t tell,” “I can
never go back;” and yet her manner expressed fervent,
grateful affection towards her young mistress. Isa was
convinced that the girl’s obstinate reserve was not that
of indifference or of pride.</p>

<p>“Lottie, you quite grieve me,” said Isa at length, as
she turned to depart, lingering at the open door with her
fingers on the handle, to give the girl an opportunity of
calling her back.</p>

<p>Lottie clutched her own black hair with both her
hands, and tore it, as if physical pain could relieve the
anguish of her heart. She turned suddenly away to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
window, to escape as far as she could from the presence
of her lady. Edith, waiting in the carriage below,
chanced to glance up at the moment, and caught sight
of a young face clouded with an expression of such
misery as she had never seen on a countenance before.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mr. Eardley, having resolved, if
possible, to clear up the mystery, and at least ascertain
whether poor Lottie were not unjustly accused of dishonesty,
walked over to Wildwaste Lodge. He was
much disappointed at not finding Miss Gritton at home,
but asked for an interview with her brother.</p>

<p>“Master ain’t very well, he don’t see visitors,” said
Hannah, who, grumbling at being left to do all the
work of the house, had come out from the kitchen
smoothing her soiled apron and pulling down her tucked-up
sleeves.</p>

<p>“I have walked from Axe, being anxious to speak on
a matter of some importance,” said the heated and
weary clergyman. “Pray, ask Mr. Gritton to have the
kindness to see me but for five minutes.”</p>

<p>Ushered into the study, Mr. Eardley almost immediately
entered on the object of his visit. Gaspar was
embarrassed; he had not contemplated the difficulties
which must arise from Lottie’s faithful adherence to her
promise.</p>

<p>“Really, sir, I can’t be answerable for—I can’t be
expected to know anything about the doings of a girl<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
like Lottie.” Gaspar took a large pinch of snuff to
cover his embarrassment.</p>

<p>“But what I am most anxious to ascertain is this:
has anything been missed here, is there the slightest
cause to suspect the young girl of dishonesty?” Gaspar
could not meet the gaze of the clear eyes that were fixed
upon him.</p>

<p>“No; she’s no thief; she’s awkward, ignorant, but
honest—yes, perfectly honest.” The words were spoken
as if with effort, and again Gaspar had recourse to his
snuff-box.</p>

<p>“That is a great relief to me; that is what I wanted
to ascertain. I thank you, Mr. Gritton,” said the
clergyman, rising; “I need not longer intrude on your
time.”</p>

<p>As Mr. Eardley was about to depart, Isa returned
from her fruitless expedition to Axe. To her the presence
of the vicar was ever welcome, and more than
usually so at the present moment. She eagerly related
to him all that had happened, as far as her knowledge
extended, emphatically confirming Gaspar’s testimony as
to the perfect honesty of poor Lottie.</p>

<p>The interview did not last as long as either Henry
Eardley or Isa would have wished, as Hannah came
clattering in with the tray to prepare for early dinner.
It would have been an act of common courtesy to have
asked the weary minister to stop and partake of the meal.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
Isa glanced at her brother, without whose assent she
dared not give the invitation which was upon her lips,
but Gaspar did not choose to understand the look; hospitality
was foreign to his nature, and to his sister’s
mortification he suffered the tired guest to depart unrefreshed.</p>

<p>Henry Eardley left the Lodge with a joyous feeling of
a more complicated nature than would have arisen only
from satisfaction at having been relieved of painful doubts
in regard to a member of his flock. His thoughts were
by no means absorbed by the case of Lottie, though
he went out of his way to let it be known in the cottage
of Holdich, and in various dwellings in Axe, that the
young maid had not been dismissed for any fault, and
that she had taken nothing with her that was not honestly
her own.</p>

<p>Mr. Eardley did what he could to clear the character
of Lottie from the imputation resting upon it; but it is
as easy to force back an overflowing river into its usual
channel as to stay the flood of calumny when once it has
spread far and wide. The vicar could not throw light
on the mystery of Lottie’s hasty flight from Wildwaste,
or her possession of a considerable sum of money for
which she would not account.</p>

<p>“Folk may talk till they’re black in the face,” said
Mrs. Green to her neighbour the baker, “but they can’t
talk away them five bright sovereigns as I seed with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
these eyes. Girls can’t make gold pieces out of old tea-leaves;
and if any one gave ’em to her, why don’t she
say so at once?”</p>

<p>Young Stone returned to his lodging that evening
with a black eye and a great swelling on his
brow.</p>

<p>“O Steady, you have had one of your falls!” exclaimed
Lottie, with affectionate sympathy.</p>

<p>The lad’s face was working with suppressed emotion.
He sat down heavily, and passed his hand through his
mass of shaggy light hair before he replied in his slow,
peculiar drawl,—</p>

<p>“Bat Maule says—says he—you took fifteen pounds
from your master’s desk, and he was a-goin’ to send
you to jail, only Miss Isa begged and prayed, and so he
let you off.”</p>

<p>It was a long speech for the lad to utter; his drawled-out
words fell on Lottie’s ear like the drip, drip of water,
which is said at length to produce madness in the victim
on whose head it descends.</p>

<p>“And what did you say?” exclaimed the miserable
Lottie, starting up from her seat.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say nothing, I knocked him down,” replied
Steady; “but he did the like by me.”</p>

<p>The lad pressed his rag of a handkerchief against his
bruised and swollen forehead—the stain of blood was
upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>“Hurt for me!” moaned Lottie, whose courage was
beginning to give way under her complicated trials.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d clear up about that money,” her
brother went on, “’cause I can’t knock down all them
folk as talk, and I can’t stand hearing ’em call you a
thief.”</p>

<p>Lottie went up to the lad, threw her arms round his
neck, and sobbed on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Don’t take on so—don’t take on so,” said poor
weak-witted Steady, almost beginning himself to cry in
his rough sympathy with his sister. “I trust you,
Lottie, you ain’t no thief; but why—why won’t you
clear up?”</p>

<p>And still that painful silence had to be maintained,
that cruel promise had to be kept. A hundred times
was Lottie on the point of breaking it, but simple faith
kept her firm in temptation. To break her word would
be to disobey her Lord; it was better to suffer than to
sin. “But oh!” thought Lottie, “it’s a blessing that
mother is away; how could I have kept any secret from
her!”</p>

<p>Poor Steady’s rude championship of his sister had
been worse than useless; it only, as was the case with
any violent excitement, brought on one of his sudden
attacks, which, though very brief in duration, were
always distressing, and very painful to witness. Sleep,
however, soon removed from the afflicted lad all consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
of earthly trouble; but for Lottie there was no rest
throughout all the night. She heard the church-clock
strike every hour as she lay on her pallet-bed, almost too
wretched even for tears.</p>

<p>“But oh,” thought the poor girl, “it’s such a comfort
that there is One who knows all; He knows that I did
no wrong, except—except in letting curiosity lead me
on, and touching that bag of gold, and thinking those
wicked, covetous thoughts. But He has forgiven me—I
feel that He has, though He lets me suffer for my folly.
It seems as if all my friends and my comforts were being
a-taken from me together. Mother away—father ill—Mr.
Eardley and my dear lady vexed and displeased—all
my neighbours turning against me—even poor Steady
scarcely knowing what to think of me, though he will
never desert me. It is just as Mr. Eardley said in his
lecture, all my blossoms are falling from the tree.” The
idea linked itself on to others connected with Gideon
when his faith was in trial, when, just before the struggle
with the foe, he was constrained to deprive himself of
the help of those on whose support he had counted.
“It must have seemed strange and hard to him,” mused
Lottie, “to have had the greater part of his friends sent
from him, with all these fierce enemies gathering in front.
Now it seems as if my Midianites were getting stronger
than ever, and I more helpless against them. There’s
dreadful Disappointment, and worse than Discontent, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
I seem at Dissension with all my neighbours, though I
never willingly did them wrong; and as for Distrust, ’tis
just crushing me down, for I can’t see any way out of
my troubles, and it looks as if the Lord had forsaken me.
And now those of whom I would have said, ‘They will
always comfort and care for me and trust me,’ are those
who cause me most grief and pain. They are still good,
patient, and kind; yet I have, as it were, to send them
from me, and struggle with temptation alone. But God
gave victory to Gideon in a way that man would not
have thought of. It was not to make him really weaker
that he was deprived of his friends; I suppose that it
was to make him rest more entirely on God. Perhaps
that is why a poor child like me is left so desolate now.
I look to this side, and to that side, and no one seems
able to help me; and then, when there’s hope nowhere
else, I look up straight to my God. I should like to
hear more of what happened to Gideon. I think that I
could walk to Mrs. Holdich’s cottage on Friday with
Steady, who goes whenever he can. It would be dreadful,
indeed, to face all the people; do they not look upon
me as a thief! And yet,” said the poor girl, half aloud,
raising herself on her elbow, as the first morning ray
glimmered through her casement, “I should like to show
to all that I am not ashamed, that I dare show my face
before my accusers. I should like Mr. Eardley to see
that I prize his holy words—for, oh! I need them—I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
need the comfort and strength which only religion can
give. It would be a pleasure, too, to look on the face of
my sweet young mistress; I would not speak to her—oh,
no—but I do so long to see her; and I would quietly
slip away as soon as the prayer was done.”</p>

<p>The resolution thus taken seemed to calm the mind of
Lottie, or perhaps Nature at last was claiming her rights,
and sorrow of mind gave way to overpowering weariness
of body. Deeply and peacefully the young girl slept,
with her hands folded as if in prayer.</p>

<p>Lottie rose with a brave spirit, though a heavy heart;
she was resolved to seek comfort in a clear conscience
toward man and a humble confidence in her God, however
painful might be the struggle before her. Lottie
did not sit down in idle sorrow, though she shrank from
quitting her lodging; for wherever she went she would
have to encounter suspicious looks and cruel taunts.
The young maid read her chapter, and said her prayers
with her brother, and after giving him his simple breakfast,
set resolutely to work to prepare, as she said, for
her parents’ return. The room was thoroughly washed
and scrubbed—even the window-panes cleaned; and
when the little place had been made the picture of neatness,
Lottie turned to mending her brother’s garments,
in which many a darn and many a patch showed the
skill of her busy fingers. The most trying event of the
day to Lottie was a second long interview with her pastor;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
but she again resisted the almost overpowering temptation
to pour out her whole heart to him, and to tell him
all that had happened. It was a satisfaction to find that
Mr. Eardley had no suspicion of her honesty, notwithstanding
the mystery regarding the money; and that Miss
Gritton had never doubted that honesty for a moment.
Lottie saw that the clergyman was now rather perplexed
than displeased by her reserve; and when, with her
honest eyes looking full into his, she assured him that if
he knew all he would not blame her silence, it was a
relief to the poor child to feel that he had not lost faith
in her word.</p>

<p>Friday brought no tidings from Southampton. Lottie
felt keenly “the sickening pang of hope deferred,” and
she had now but little occupation wherewith to fill up
the tedious hours. The day passed slowly and wearily,
till it was time to start for the cottage-meeting. Glad
was Lottie to leave Axe, though only for a space so brief;
the cottage of Holdich was connected in her mind only
with thoughts of holiness and peace, and she was thankful
to be permitted still to kneel as a worshipper there.</p>

<h3>LECTURE V.—FAITH CONFIRMED.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Lord is mindful of His own, He remembereth
His people. He may, indeed, permit faith to be
put to sharp trial, but His love supports His
servant through it. If, as in the case of Gideon,
God removeth earthly friends; if He take from us the
prop of human aid, He can supply other props, and
even from the enemy’s camp. When friends are silent,
encouragement can come from the lips of a foe. A
Balaam, eager to curse, has been made an instrument
to bless.</p>

<p>Strong as was the faith of Gideon, we cannot wonder
if a feeling of misgiving arose in his mind when he looked
on the handful of men to which his force had been reduced.
How was it possible that they should meet the
shock of battle with the multitudes of Midian? They
were brave and resolute men, they would follow him to
the death; would it not be indeed <i>to the death</i>; had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
he not been selecting victims for slaughter rather than
warriors for conquest? We must conclude that some
such thoughts as these troubled the spirit of Gideon, from
the very circumstance of God’s finding it needful thus to
strengthen his faith:</p>

<p>“Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered
it into thine hand,” said the Lord. “But if
thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant
down to the host: and thou shalt hear what they say;
and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go
down unto the host.”</p>

<p>It could not have been personal fear that weighed
upon the soul of Gideon; his anxious care must have
been for the safety of others, for the success of the effort
to free his country, or formidable would have appeared
the adventure which he was called to undertake almost
alone. But Gideon appears to have had no hesitation
or fear in trusting his own life to God’s providential care.
We picture to ourselves the leader, with his single attendant,
silently treading the path towards the enemy’s camp,
lighted by the glimmering stars in the dark blue midnight
sky. How wide spreads the camp of Amalek and
Midian, how innumerable seem the dark tents within
which are slumbering foes, “like grasshoppers for multitude,”
with their camels tethered around, “as the sand
by the sea-side for multitude!” Nor are all amongst the
host sleeping: Gideon hears the sound of voices in converse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
as he approaches the tents. The man of God
stands still, as conscious that what he will hear will be
a message from God to himself.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus18.jpg" width="500" height="525" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GIDEON LISTENING.</p>
</div>

<p>“Behold, I dreamed a dream,” said one of the Midianites
to his companion, little guessing on whose ear his words
would fall; “and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled
into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote
it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>“And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing
else, save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man
of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian,
and all the host.”</p>

<p>The message from the Lord had been given, and
Gideon required no more. There, close to the unconscious
enemy, he worshipped; then returning with renewed
faith and hope to the warriors of Israel, he
cried, “Arise, for the Lord hath delivered into your
hand the host of Midian!”</p>

<p>Brethren, are we to look for such encouragements
now? The age of miracles, it may be said, is past;
we must rest upon what has already been revealed, nor
seek for wonders and signs to encourage our feeble faith.
Yet, without interrupting the course of nature, God has
His own way of giving strength to the weak and joy to
the sorrowful. An instance of this, which occurred during
the fearful Indian Mutiny, suggests itself to my mind.
Two ladies and a child were prisoners in the power of
the cruel enemy, who had destroyed the brother of one
of them by blowing him from a gun. Great must have
been the anguish of mind, the fears of these captive
ladies—they were encompassed, as it were, by the hosts
of Midian; could faith endure the fiery trial? The
child fell sick, medicine was asked for, and the captors
gave it wrapped up in a soiled piece of paper. Who
would have guessed that through the enemy of our name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
and of our faith would be sent medicine not only for the
body but the soul? With wondering joy the ladies discovered
that the scrap of paper was a leaf torn from an
English Bible, and containing such a portion of Scripture
as was most exactly suited for their comfort and refreshment.
With what emotions must the poor prisoners
have received such a message from God as this, conveyed
through the enemy’s hand: <i>I, even I, am He that comforteth
you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid
of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which
shall be made as grass; and forgettest the Lord thy
Maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid
the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually
every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if
he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the
oppressor? The captive exile hasteneth that he may be
loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his
bread should fail</i> (Isa. li. 12-15).</p>

<p>Doubtless these captive Englishwomen received those
blessed verses as a promise from God, even as Gideon did
the Midianite’s relation of his dream, and in their dreary
prison bowed their heads and worshipped. The ladies
were delivered from the fury of the oppressor; the
captive exiles were loosed; and surely with them, as
with Gideon, would faith be confirmed, not only for the
present time of peril, but through all the succeeding
years of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>When we regard faith, as we have been doing during
this course of brief lectures, under the emblem of a fruit
tree, we must remember that it is no standard rearing
itself aloft in the pride of its strength, but a plant in
itself but feeble, which must lean on the Rock of Ages;
which, even when its branches are fullest of swelling
fruit, needs the props, the supports which God’s grace
only can give. Without these supports how the branches
would lie low on the earth, their fruit be defiled with its
dust! How constantly in the history of God’s people
do we find strong consolation given at the moment when
faith is most ready to fail! To Jacob, a lonely, benighted
wanderer, is sent a bright beam of heaven.
Does he fear to encounter an angry brother? the angel
of the Lord meets him and blesses. Joshua, ere commencing
an arduous campaign, receives the promise, <i>I
will not fail thee, nor forsake thee</i>. To David comes the
assurance of his final triumph from the lips of the very
enemy engaged in hunting for his life: <i>I know well that
thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel
shall be established in thine hand</i>. But I need not
multiply instances of which the Scripture records are so
full; now, as when He dwelt upon earth, our gracious
Saviour says to the anxious, afflicted spirit, <i>Be not afraid,
only believe</i>; and to His disciples entering on the conflict
with sore temptation, <i>Let not your hearts be troubled;
ye believe in God, believe also in Me</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>Rest, therefore, ye afflicted servants of God, on the
promises made by your heavenly Master. The night of
trouble may be around you, enemies may be before you,
difficulties may press you from without, temptation assail
you from within; but this is no proof that God has forsaken
you. Are you looking to Him, trusting in Him;
are you ready, like Gideon, to go forth in His strength
to fight His battle against every besetting sin? Then
fear not, for He is on your side; <i>heaviness endureth for
a night, but joy cometh in the morning</i>; nay, more, the
Lord giveth <i>songs in the night</i>, even before the darkness
passeth away the tried one, like Gideon, may worship
God and rejoice. The believer goes from strength to
strength, even as day by day on the bough the fruit
ripens and swells towards perfection. There is a growth
in grace, an increase in love and in submission, which is
visible even to the world.</p>

<p><i>The salvation of the righteous is of the Lord: He is
their strength in the time of trouble. And the Lord
shall help them, and deliver them: He shall deliver
them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust
in Him.</i></p>

<h3>DISCLOSURE.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">“I am certain,” reflected Isa Gritton, as she retired
to rest on that night, “that Lottie Stone bears
a clear conscience, whatever her reason for
silence may be. How her poor face, worn and
anxious as it looked at first, brightened when she heard
of the support which God gives to the faith of His people
in time of need. I wish that I had had an opportunity
of speaking to her after the service was ended, but when
I rose from my knees and looked for her, she was gone.
I trust her—yes, I will trust her. Is there not a certain
degree of faith which Christians should extend one to
another, as it is the property of charity that it <i>thinketh
no evil</i>?”</p>

<p>Lottie and her strange conduct had been much on the
mind of Isa, and when she came to breakfast on the following
morning it was with the intention of proposing
again to drive over to Axe for a second interview with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
her truant little maid. But thoughts of Lottie were
driven away for the time by a subject of closer personal
interest.</p>

<p>When Isa entered the breakfast-room a little later
than usual, she found Gaspar there already, pacing up
and down the apartment with a letter in his hand, which
had come by the early post. He looked restless, excited,
and angry, and Isa saw that no light cause of annoyance
disturbed him, before he broke forth with the angry
question, “Is this your doing, Isa; have I to thank you
for this?” and thrust into the hand of his sister the note
which he had just received.</p>

<p>The epistle did not look at all formidable; it was brief,
written on tinted paper, and in a lady’s handwriting.
It was no formal law document, yet had it been read
with much the same emotions as a summons to the bar
of justice might have been. With anxiety, mingled with
interest, Miss Gritton read as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>May 1</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—I have just received information which has
greatly surprised me, to the effect that the £4000 which
I had been led to believe had been invested in property
lost in the <i>Orissa</i> was actually invested in the cargo of the
<i>St. Christopher</i>, which safely arrived at its destination,
and, as I am given to understand, realized a profit of fifty
per cent. I shall place the affair in the hands of my lawyer
unless I receive a satisfactory explanation from yourself.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
As a personal interview is desirable, I shall go
immediately to Axe, which is, I understand, in your
neighbourhood, and either appoint an hour for meeting
you at the hotel, or, as I am acquainted with your sister,
call on Miss Gritton and see you in her presence.—I have
the honour to be, &amp;c.,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Cora Madden</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>“Gaspar, I had nothing to do with this; Cora has
learned nothing from me,” said Isa, as she returned the
note to her brother.</p>

<p>He looked at her with a keen, suspicious gaze; but she
met it with that frank, open glance which carries conviction
of truthfulness even to the sceptical mind.</p>

<p>Gaspar pressed his hand to his brow, which was furrowed
with deep lines of perplexity and care. “It must
have been through the captain,” he muttered to himself;
“and yet I thought—but no matter, she’s on the scent
now, wherever she took it up. Isa, you must stand by
me,” nervously added Mr. Gritton; “you must help me
through this difficulty.”</p>

<p>“How can I help you?—I do not fully understand
even the nature of the difficulty,” said Isa. She paused
to give her brother an opportunity for explanation, but
he only had recourse to his snuff-box. Isa pressed him
no further; she had a painful conviction, as she looked
upon her unhappy brother, that he was unable to give any
explanation which would satisfy her own sense of honour.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus19.jpg" width="500" height="575" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GASPAR’S ALARM.</p>
</div>

<p>The state of the case may be briefly laid before the
reader. Gaspar had already invested largely himself in
the cargo of the <i>Orissa</i>, when he had received directions
in regard to the money of Miss Madden. Unwilling that
her interests should clash with his own, the <i>Orissa</i> being
the fastest sailer on the line, and the hope of large profits
depending much on being first in the market, Gaspar had
placed the property of his client in the <i>St. Christopher</i>,
intending to apprise the lady that he had been unable to
ship in the vessel which had first started. While yet in
the Channel, the <i>Orissa</i> had foundered in a storm, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
Gaspar’s investment in her hold. The loss of so much
property had been a great shock to one whose soul was
bent upon gain; Gaspar had been overwhelmed by the
unexpected misfortune, when the Tempter had suggested
to him a means by which the loss might actually be converted
into profit. Few knowing anything of the circumstances
of Cora’s investment, still fewer having any
interest in the subject, it might be possible, by an exercise
of craft, to make it appear that the lady’s property had
been in the <i>Orissa</i>, and that Gaspar’s own had been embarked
in the ship which had safely arrived.</p>

<p>Gaspar had at first shrunk from the wicked suggestion.
Though he was not a very scrupulous man, there was yet
a sufficient sense of honour left within his breast to make
him aware of the enormity of the crime to which he was
tempted. But <i>the love of money is the root of all evil</i>,
and with Gaspar it had become an absorbing passion; he
was also proud of the possession of that miserable cunning
which some deem cleverness, but which is foolishness
indeed in the sight of a holy God. Conscience and a
feeling of honour,—these were the barriers which, for a
short time, had resisted the pressure of strong temptation;
for Gaspar <i>had</i> a conscience, though by covetousness
long-indulged its power had been greatly weakened. But
the barriers had given way, and Gaspar having once
grasped unlawful gain, and added to his stores the gold
which rightfully belonged to another, soon experienced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
the natural consequence of yielding to sin. His heart
had become hardened, his nature debased, and he had
fallen more and more completely under the dominion of
the vice of covetousness which he had once suffered to
subdue him. A hard and merciless task-master he had
found it! While haunted with a perpetual dread of disgrace,
and fear of losing his ill-gotten wealth, Gaspar
could not enjoy it. He was poor in the midst of riches,
miserable in the possession of that for which he had sold
his conscience. Notwithstanding every precaution, Gaspar’s
secret had oozed out, and fears of exposure—ruin—shame—rose
up before him like phantoms.</p>

<p>“She may be here this very day,” were the first words
from the miserable man which broke the oppressive
silence. “Isa, you must not quit the house—you must
remain beside me—you know Miss Madden, and may
influence her mind.”</p>

<p>“I influence Cora!” exclaimed Isa; “I know her,
indeed—perhaps too well—but ours was never the intimacy
of friendship!” The young lady spoke with some
emotion, for every recollection connected with Cora was
bitter. It is true that Isa no longer regarded her
separation from Lionel as a misfortune. Since she had
come so near to the place of his former sojourn, light had
been thrown on his character which had revealed something
of its selfishness and hollowness, and upon the
young maiden purer hopes were dawning than even those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
of first love; but still, of all beings upon earth, Cora
Madden was the one whom Isa regarded with most fear
and aversion. She looked upon Cora as an impersonification
of malice; as a dangerous woman; the bearer of
the apple of discord; one who delighted to turn into
ridicule all whose standard of duty was higher than her
own. Isa had struggled to keep down the feelings of
restraint which swelled in her heart, and, like Edith,
never to speak of her enemy save to her God; she had
tried to banish Cora even from her memory; but now it
appeared that she might be brought into close contact
with Miss Madden, and in a way most painful. Isa
could not close her eyes to the fact that her brother stood
in a humiliating position, and innocent as she herself
was, she must yet share his humiliation. She must see
scorn—just scorn—on that haughty lip whose sneer had
already stung her like a scorpion; she might have to ask
indulgence from one to whom she could with difficulty
accord forgiveness. All Isa’s natural pride rose up in
arms against this. Why should she endure the shame
when innocent of the guilt? Let Gaspar abide the
consequences of his own conduct, whatever that conduct
might have been; she would leave him to make what
explanation, arrange what compromise he could; she
would go to the Castle, where no word of reproach, no
glance of scorn would ever reach her, where she would
be welcomed by relatives whose behaviour had never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
brought a blush to her cheek. This was Isa’s thought
for a moment, but it was instantly put aside as selfish,
ungenerous, unkind. Her brother, at this time of all
others, had need of her sympathy, counsel, and support.
She might help him to struggle not only against outward
difficulties, but the inward enemies—the Midianites—that
had brought him into this strait—that had struck
at his honour, and destroyed his peace. Might not the
disclosure which had covered him with shame be a means
of loosening his fetters? The social worship of the preceding
evening, the prayers which she had heard uttered
by one whom, of all men, she most honoured, had braced
the spirit of Isa. The whole history of Gideon was to
her as a commentary on the text, <i>Be strong in the Lord,
and in the power of His might</i>. She would, in her
maiden meekness, stand at the post where God had placed
her, stand against the spiritual foes of her soul; she
would not sink under disappointment, yield to discontent,
or harbour distrust of her Lord. She would ask for
strength, and look for strength, and believe that strength
would be given.</p>

<p>Isa’s first struggle was against the feeling of contempt
inspired by the conduct of Gaspar. If it were wrong to
desert her brother, was it not also wrong to despise him;
and yet how closely did her very pity seem to be allied
with scorn! Now that for the first time Gaspar turned
to her for sympathy, he must find it; not sympathy with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
his wretched grasping at gain, but with him in the pain
and perplexity into which that grasping had brought him.
Mr. Gritton was in a miserable state of indecision, and
Isa was the sole confidante of his troubles; as she already
knew so much, he almost unconsciously let her know all.
Now he clung to the hope that what Cora suspected she
would find it impossible to prove, that he might safely
abide even the issue of a lawsuit: then all his thoughts
were turned towards a compromise which might save his
honour without too far trenching on his interests; much
might be done in a personal interview; an inexperienced
woman might easily be induced to compound for the
restoration of part of her property, by yielding up her
claim to the residue. After long, restless pacing up and
down the room, revolving various plans and expedients,
Gaspar threw himself on a chair by his sister, and nervously
opened to her his views, concluding by saying in
an embarrassed tone, “You will explain—you will soften—you
will induce Miss Madden to listen to reason.”</p>

<p>“Gaspar, dear Gaspar, suffer me to speak freely and
openly to you,” said Isa, whose mind had been as actively
engaged as that of her brother as she had sat silent by
the casement, with her untouched work lying on her
knee. “When we have gone out of the straight way,
surely, surely our first care should be to retrace our
steps; if any wrong has been done, should it not be set
right without further delay?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>“I want your help, and not your advice,” muttered
Gaspar.</p>

<p>“Yet hear me,” said Isa earnestly, for she felt that
something more precious than her brother’s interests,
more dear than even his reputation, was at stake. “I
know that you have been unhappy—I have seen it;
your better, your nobler nature, has been oppressed by a
burden which—which you may now throw off and for
ever. Oh, deal frankly and fairly by Cora Madden!
Give her what is her due, principal and interest, even to
the utmost farthing: poverty is no evil, want itself is no
evil, compared with the gnawing consciousness of possessing
that which cannot have God’s blessing upon it.”</p>

<p>Gaspar pressed his thin bloodless lips together, as if
suppressing a groan. He felt his sister’s fervent appeal—it
found an echo in his own conscience; but he was
not yet prepared to throw down his idol, to burst from
the yoke which galled. Mr. Gritton rose hastily, without
replying, and resumed his restless walk. Isa could
but guess the nature of the struggle going on within, and
silently pray that God might strengthen the faith of the
tempted one, and give victory to the right.</p>

<p>If not the most painful, that was certainly one of the
most tedious days that had ever been passed by Isa Gritton.
Gaspar was irritable, nervous, wretched; vacillating
as a pendulum, never in the same mind for twenty
minutes together. He appeared to be constantly on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
watch; never left the house, stood often gazing forth
from the window, and nervously started at every unusual
sound. There seemed to Isa to be a spell on the hands
of her watch, they moved so slowly; she could not pursue
her accustomed occupations, for Gaspar was unwilling
to have her out of his sight, and was perpetually interrupting
her with snatches of conversation. But the long
day closed at last—closed in mist and rain; a dull white
fog blotted out the landscape, and ere the hour of sunset,
twilight closed in. Isa tried to beguile the evening by
reading aloud, but even the work on commercial statistics
entirely failed to interest Gaspar. His mind was abstracted,
his ear painfully on the strain for other sounds
than those of his sister’s melodious voice. Glad was Isa
when the hour at length arrived when she could retire,
and prepare herself, by devotional reading, prayer, and
then rest, for whatever the morrow might bring.</p>

<h3>MERCY AND SELF-DENIAL.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Sabbath morning rose clear and bright,
Nature looking all the fairer for the tears
which she had shed on the previous night. As
Isa Gritton was completing her toilet, Hannah
brought in a note. Isa instantly recognized the handwriting;
and as this missive had evidently not passed
through the post, but been brought by a messenger,
the young lady, with some anxiety, broke open the
envelope and read its contents:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><i>Saturday Evening.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Miss Gritton</span>,—I was on the way to Axe, but
felt so ill with feverish headache that I could not proceed
beyond this wretched little inn (the Black Bear), which,
as I hear, is not ten minutes’ walk from your house.
Could you come over and see me?—Yours,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Cora Madden.</span></p>

</div>

<p>“Who brought this?” inquired Isa of Hannah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>“Mrs. Taylor, the landlady of the ‘Black Bear.’
She’s a-waiting below, and she says that she wants to
see you partic’lar.”</p>

<p>Isa hastened down-stairs, and found in the hall the
landlady of the roadside public-house, which had been
dignified with the name of an inn on the strength of the
single guest-chamber which it held above the tap-room.
Cora Madden must have felt ill indeed before she
accepted such shelter. The landlady was a woman of a
coarse and vulgar stamp, deeply pitted with small-pox,
and with a strong scent of spirits about her. Isa
felt repugnance at the idea of paying a visit at her
house.</p>

<p>“The lady writ that last night,” said Mrs. Taylor, not
waiting to be questioned, but speaking loud and fast and
without a pause; “but it warn’t convenient to send it
over, for Tom hadn’t come in, and Jim hadn’t just his
legs; and ’twas lucky I didn’t, ’cause we did not know
what it was, and now it’s all come out red as fire.”</p>

<p>“What has come out? what do you mean?” asked
Miss Gritton.</p>

<p>“The small-pox, miss; quite full out—not a place on
her face where you could lay a sixpenny bit. It’s very
unlucky it’s in my house, but the chay put up in the
stables last night, and the man’s a-going to put the
horse to—”</p>

<p>“Stop!” exclaimed Isa; “let me understand you.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
Do you mean to tell me that Miss Madden is lying ill of
small-pox in your house?”</p>

<p>“But won’t stop there long—couldn’t think of it.
I’ve six children, and I nigh died of small-pox myself
these thirty years back, so I know what it be; and it’s
a great shame, it is, to come a-sickening in the midst of
a family, and get an inn the name of being infected.
But she’s a-going at once back to Portal, or on to Axe,
afore she’s an hour older.”</p>

<p>“A moment—listen!” cried Isa, interrupting with
difficulty the loud incoherent rattle of the landlady;
“are you going to send away a lady ill of the small-pox,
without so much as knowing where she can find a place
of shelter?”</p>

<p>“I guess there be lodgings to be had somewhere; if
not at one place at another; they’ll drive about till they
find ’un; she can’t stay with me: I’ve a large family,
and thirty years back come Michaelmas I—”</p>

<p>Isa Gritton pressed her hand to her forehead, trying
to collect her thoughts, distracted by the vociferous talking.
A new difficulty had, most unexpectedly, risen
before her; a sudden emergency, and—as something
seemed to whisper within—a call for the exercise of Christian
mercy towards one whom she had regarded as a foe.</p>

<p>The sound of Mrs. Taylor’s loud voice drew Gaspar
Gritton out of his room. “Who is here? is anything
the matter?” he cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>“It cant be expected that I should turn my house
into an hospital, and frighten away customers and—”
Mrs. Taylor would have pursued her remarks had she
had any listener, but Isa, anxious and troubled in countenance,
had drawn her brother into the study.</p>

<p>“Gaspar, Cora is at the ‘Black Bear,’ ill with small-pox.
The landlady is going to send her away at once
to find a shelter where she may. Oh, were the complaint
anything but small-pox, it would seem but common
charity to offer her a refuge here!”</p>

<p>“And lay her under obligation; ay, ay, I see—lay
her under deepest obligation—I see, I see; the best
thing that could possibly be done!” cried Gaspar.</p>

<p>Isa was startled at her brother’s eagerness; her words
had been the intuitive expression of the feelings of a
generous spirit, but she had not seriously contemplated
bringing a small-pox patient into her home. Gaspar saw
his sister’s cheek turn pale, and became aware that the
step proposed must be attended not only with great personal
inconvenience, but serious hazard to his young and
beautiful sister. Unlike her brother, Isa had never yet
had the malady, and regarded it with considerable dread.
It was not only the peril to life, and the minor risk of
permanent disfigurement, which made Isa shrink from
exposing herself to infection, but the quarantine to which
she must be subjected while nursing a patient in small-pox
would be, especially at this time, a very serious trial.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
It would be like a sudden calling back of winter when
the blossoms of spring were opening to sweetest fragrance
and brightest beauty. Even the dull comfortless days
at Wildwaste had been gemmed with some moments of
such exquisite happiness as had almost served to
brighten the whole; and now must the door be closed
against even Edith and Henry Eardley, because it had
been opened to receive Cora Madden? Gaspar read
strong repugnance to the sacrifice in the expressive
countenance of his sister.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he said; “you might take the infection.
Miss Madden must try her chance somewhere else.”</p>

<p>“Let me consider for a few moments, Gaspar. Detain
the woman, I must ask counsel ere I decide;” and Isa
hurriedly sought her own room, to sink on her knees
and implore guidance and light on the tangled path
opening before her.</p>

<p>There were a few words which Isa had heard from the
lips of the vicar of Axe, which she had laid up in her
heart for a time of perplexity like this:—“When you
are in doubt as to what course to pursue, when reason
appears to be lost in a mist, and you cannot clearly discern
the narrow path of duty, ask conscience two simple
questions,—‘Were my Lord in visible presence here, what
would He bid me do? what may I venture to believe
that He would have done in my place?’ Such questions,
honestly put, and in a spirit of prayer, will draw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
forth such a reply as will clear off the mist, and be as
the voice saying, <i>This is the way, walk ye in it, when
ye turn to the right hand or to the left.</i>”</p>

<p>Isa obeyed the direction now; bending her head over
her clasped hands, with the prayer, “Oh, guide me,
Lord, by Thy counsel!” she asked conscience the two
simple questions. Familiar words of Scripture recurred
to her mind,—<i>Whatsoever ye would that men should do
unto you, do ye also so unto them</i>. What would she
desire if, like Cora, she were ill, desolate, and alone,
driven from the shelter even of a miserable wayside inn,
and sent to seek from house to house a place in which
to lay—perchance a dying head? And what would
have been the conduct of the Merciful One towards such
a sufferer, however erring, however guilty? Would He
have paused to consider whether she were a foe or a
friend? <i>Christ pleased not Himself</i>, and He <i>hath left
an example that we should follow His steps</i>.</p>

<p>Isa rose from her knees, and calling the servant, whom
she heard spreading the breakfast in the adjoining apartment,
she at once gave orders for preparing for the reception
of a lady ill of small-pox. Isa would give up her
own sleeping-room to Cora, and have Lottie’s little
pallet-bed placed in the boudoir for herself. Leaving
Hannah wondering and grumbling, Isa returned to her
brother and informed him of her decision. Gaspar, glad
that it was such as might further his own selfish interests,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
sent off Mrs. Taylor to make arrangements for
Cora’s removal to Wildwaste Lodge.</p>

<p>Isa had won another silent victory over the Midianites
within, over Selfishness, Vanity, and Fear. One sacrifice
had given her strength for another. Under the influence
of that faith which worketh by love, Isa made
every preparation for the comfort of Cora that she could
have made for that of a cherished sister, giving her own
efforts to make up for the shortness of time and the incapacity
or unwillingness of her servant. Not more
than half an hour elapsed before a chaise drove up to
the door, where Isa Gritton stood ready to welcome
Cora Madden. The driver feared to help out the invalid,
who—swathed in blankets, a miserable, disfigured
object—would have been forced to descend without aid,
and drag her tottering limbs into the house, had not Isa’s
hands been stretched out to support—had not Isa’s
slight arm been thrown gently around her. Cora crossed
the threshold, and feebly walked up the staircase, resting
upon the woman whose peace she for a time had blighted,
whose prospects she had done her utmost to destroy!
Self-denying kindness may be shown to a friend from
natural affection—to a stranger from intuitive pity; but
when shown to a bitter enemy, it is one of the strongest
proofs that the love of Christ which constraineth hath
been shed abroad in the heart.</p>

<p>“You are indeed a good Samaritan; God will bless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
you for it!” murmured Cora, as she sank upon her comfortable
bed, while Isa gently beat up the pillow to support
the aching head of her guest. Never had a blessing
from any other lips gone so warm to the heart of Isa; it
was a blessing wrung, as it were, from an enemy; it
was as the encouraging word heard by Gideon on the
night when he stood in the camp of the foe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus20.jpg" width="500" height="525" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE ARRIVAL OF MISS MADDEN</p>
</div>

<p>Gaspar had sent from the hamlet a messenger for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
doctor. He came before noon, and pronounced that Miss
Madden had not been injured by her removal, and that
with care she was likely to do well. He prescribed absolute
quietness, and forbade her speaking much on any
subject, especially such as might excite her. But it was
easier for the doctor to give the order than it was for Isa
to enforce it. Her patient little merited the name. Cora
was eager to speak on business; and Isa could scarcely
soothe her into silence by entreating that she would wait
a few days, and that then she might have an interview
with Mr. Gritton himself.</p>

<p>Gaspar had made the unusual effort of walking over
to the steward’s cottage, to speak to Mr. Holdich about
a nurse to assist his sister. Rebekah at once volunteered
to go herself, if her husband’s consent were obtained,
and to Isa’s great relief appeared at the Lodge just as
the doctor quitted it. Not only were her experience
and willing help a great comfort to the young lady, but
the presence of a gentle, pious woman, sympathizing and
kind, was a real pleasure to Isa. Much cheerful converse
they had together in the boudoir, with the door
open between it and the room in which Cora lay sleeping.
Rebekah had many a pleasant anecdote to relate
to an attentive hearer, of Edith and of one dearer than
Edith. Never had Isa listened to tale of romance with
half the interest with which she did now to the account of
the difficulties which had to be overcome, and the efforts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
to be made by the vicar of Axe, to introduce a knowledge
of vital religion into that remote and benighted part of
his parish which surrounded Castle Lestrange.</p>

<p>The tidings of Cora’s illness and its nature was not
long in reaching the little country town of Axe. Mrs.
Green stood at the door of her shop on the Monday
morning, exchanging gossip with her neighbour the
baker.</p>

<p>“If ever there was a parson like ours!” she observed.
“Always at work, Sundays and week-days; and as
anxious about his folk as if they were all his children.
He was here again, not an hour ago, to look after that
little thief upstairs; but I chanced to say to him, ‘I
s’pose you’ve heard, sir, as Miss Madden’s lying sick of
small-pox at Wildwaste Lodge?’ and he looked as if he’d
heard sudden of the death of his father, and repeated,
‘Small-pox—Wildwaste Lodge!’ as if the words was a
knell.”</p>

<p>“I dare say Mr. Eardley’s sorry for the poor lady; she
was his parishioner some years ago when the Maddens
lived at the Castle.”</p>

<p>“He must have taken an uncommon interest in her,”
said Mrs. Green with a smile, “for he forgot all about
what he’d come for, and was off for the Lodge like a
shot. He’s not one to be afeard of infection; he sat
up all night with poor Bramley, when he was a-dying
of the fever. Maybe he thinks that if Miss Madden’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
in a bad way, she might like to have a word with a
parson.”</p>

<p>“She was one of the worldly and gay,” observed the
baker, shaking his head. “I don’t believe that she and
Mr. Eardley had ever much to say to one another; but
she’s the sister of his friend Mr. Arthur, and the vicar
may care for her for his sake.”</p>

<p>Had the duty of spiritual visitation been all that had
led Henry Eardley to bend his rapid steps towards Wildwaste,
he must have returned to Axe disappointed.
Cora had passed a favourable night, and suffered little
but from the extreme irritation caused by her malady.
When Isa softly glided to her side, and whispered that
the clergyman had called to inquire for her, and to know
whether she had any wish to see him, Cora replied with
a characteristic sneer, “I’m not dying; and if I were, I
would send for the undertaker as soon as the parson.”</p>

<p>And yet it was with no feeling of disappointment that
Henry Eardley went on his homeward way. He turned
from the dull, unsightly brick building on the common,
as one loath to leave the earthly paradise in which has
been passed a golden hour of life. His interview with
Isa had indeed been but brief, but it was one which left
memories behind which would remain fragrant in his
soul to the close of his mortal existence.</p>

<p>“Priceless jewel enclosed in yon dull casket!” said
Henry Eardley to himself, turning to give a parting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
glance at Isa’s home. “May Heaven watch over that
precious one’s life, and shield her from the danger to
which her noble, unselfish devotion has exposed her.”</p>

<p>That prayer welled up from the depths of the vicar’s
soul. It was for one of whom he for the first time dared
to let himself think as possibly the future partner of all
his joys and his sorrows, his guardian angel, his treasure.
Henry Eardley had been fascinated by Isa when meeting
her at the Castle; but a painful misgiving had rested on
his mind as to whether she, the bright ornament of
society, flattered and admired, were suited for, or could
ever endure the life of lowly active usefulness which that
of a vicar’s wife should be. From the time when he had
first given himself to the ministry, Mr. Eardley had
made a firm resolve, that should he ever ask a woman
in marriage, she should be one who would be his helper,
and not his hinderer, in doing his Master’s work. A
pastor and his wife should be as the two hands of a
watch—the one moving in a larger circle and with more
visible activity than the other, but both fixed on the
same centre, both moved by the same spring, united in
the same work, and pointing to the same truth. With
this conviction on his mind, Henry Eardley had almost
resolved to shun the society of the baronet’s niece as a
dangerous pleasure; such a bird of paradise, he thought,
would never brook the lowly perch, the secluded nest.
But when he saw Isa pale from watching by the sick-bed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
of a comparative stranger, for whom the beauteous
had risked the loss of beauty, and the youthful that of
life, all such misgivings passed for ever away. Henry
Eardley felt that if he dare but aspire to the hand of
Isa Gritton, even were the malady which she had braved
to rob her of all her loveliness, he would be of all men
on earth the most blessed. That which the maiden had
feared would divide her from him whose regard she most
valued, was but as a golden link to bind them together
for ever.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Better go back, Lottie; ye were dead tired
last time,” said Steady to his sister on the
evening of the next lecture, as she sat down
by the road-side to rest, on her way to the
steward’s cottage.</p>

<p>“I was not half so tired as my heart felt afore I went
to the meeting,” replied Lottie. “Thought I, if I don’t
get some help with this burden of trouble, I’ll just lie
down and die. All the people looking so strangely at
me, and speaking so cruelly of me—no news from
mother—no news of poor father—and now my dear
young mistress nursing a lady in the small-pox, and I
away! Oh, if she catches it!” Lottie started up as if
the idea had inspired her with fresh energy, “I will go
and nurse her; nothing shall stay me; she shall see that
I ain’t ungrateful.”</p>

<p>“Maybe she won’t catch it,” observed Steady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>“I pray God with all my heart and soul that she may
not!” cried Lottie. “I should like,” she continued,
more quietly, as she plodded along the dusty highroad
with her brother—“I should like to have nursed Miss
Madden, not ’cause I care for her, but for the sake of her
brother, Mr. Arthur.”</p>

<p>“He was the best friend as ever we had,” observed
Steady.</p>

<p>“He taught us about heaven—he helped us in trouble—he
worked so hard to put out the fire when the flames
were a’most catching our cottage. And to think of his
lying dying far, far away in Jerusalem!” The black
eyes of Lottie Stone were brimming over with tears.</p>

<p>“Mind—you’ll be run over!” exclaimed Steady, suddenly
pulling his sister to one side, out of the way of an
open carriage which was coming up rapidly behind them.
The Stones had been walking in the centre of the road.</p>

<p>Full as she was of her own mournful thoughts, Lottie
did not even look at the carriage as it whirled past; but
she was startled by a voice from it suddenly exclaiming,
“Stop, coachman, stop! Yes; that is Lottie Stone,
with her brother!”</p>

<p>Lottie uttered a low cry of delight as she glanced up
and recognized the face—emaciated, indeed, and very
pale—of the benefactor of her family, as he bent smiling
from the carriage to greet those whom he had not seen
for years. Arthur Madden and his sister Lina had a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
hours before arrived at Axe, having hastened thither
immediately upon reaching England, from hearing tidings
of the illness of Cora. They had been relieved from
anxiety on her account by Mr. Eardley, from whom they
learned that the invalid was in a fair way to recover.
Medical men had strictly forbidden Arthur to expose
himself in his weakened state to any hazard of infection;
and Lina, his devoted nurse, was thankful not to be
obliged to leave him, as the clergyman informed her how
tenderly Cora was watched over by Isa Gritton.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus21.jpg" width="500" height="425" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE RECOGNITION.</p>
</div>

<p>Arthur and Lina had taken up their quarters at a
quiet hotel at Axe. A message from the former to the
vicar had brought Mr. Eardley instantly to see them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
With hearty joy and fervent thanksgiving, Henry wrung
the thin hand of his friend.</p>

<p>“The accounts of you had been so alarming that I had
hardly ventured to hope to see your face again in this
world!” cried the vicar.</p>

<p>“The voyage did me much good; and the sight of
dear familiar faces will do me much more,” said Arthur.
“I long to be again amongst my old pupils at Wildwaste,
and to meet with honest Holdich once more. Do
you still hold your little week-day services in that honey-suckle-mantled
cottage, which is connected in my mind
with some of its pleasant recollections?”</p>

<p>“I hold one there this evening,” replied Mr. Eardley.</p>

<p>“Then we will go to it,” cried Arthur Madden; “it
will so remind us of <i>auld lang syne</i>. Nay, no remonstrance,
Lina,” he added gaily, as he read an objection in
the face of his anxious young nurse; “it will <i>not</i> tire
me, it will <i>not</i> give me a chill; it will make me feel
ten years younger to find myself amongst my poor friends
again: and I should like our first meeting to be in that
place, where we used to worship together. I will ring
and order an open carriage to be here early enough to
give us half an hour for greetings before the service
begins; at least, if it be not inconvenient for you to start
so soon,” said Arthur, addressing himself to the vicar,
“for you must come with us in the carriage, and tell us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
on the way the thousand things which I wish to hear of
Wildwaste and its people.”</p>

<p>There is nothing so healthful as happiness. The keen
enjoyment which Arthur felt in returning to the place
where he had first laboured for God, where he had first
realized what a blessed thing it is to win souls for Christ,
was as a powerful tonic to his enfeebled constitution.
Never had his eye looked brighter, or his voice sounded
more cheerful, than during that drive from Axe, as he
recognized familiar landmarks, and questioned his friend,
Mr. Eardley, as to the fortunes of those whom he had
known before quitting England.</p>

<p>“I remember that Wildwaste is not in your parish.
Has it the same aged minister still?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but I hear that Mr. Bull is about to resign his
cure. He is now unable to perform even the shortest
service.”</p>

<p>“I hope and trust that an earnest, hard-working man
may be put in his place,” said Arthur.</p>

<p>“God grant it!” was the vicar’s response.</p>

<p>“And old Tychicus Bolder, the teetotaller,” inquired
young Madden after a pause; “does he still declaim as
fiercely as ever against the evils of Wildwaste?”</p>

<p>“The rod of affliction has been heavy on poor Bolder.
He suffered so greatly from rheumatism last winter that
it was feared that he might altogether lose the use of his
limbs; but he has rallied wonderfully during the last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
few days, and he expressed a hope, when I last saw him,
that he would be able to get to church again in the
summer.”</p>

<p>“He seemed to me,” observed Lina Madden, “one of
the most proud, uncharitable, and self-righteous men
that I ever had met with; but I suppose that we shall
see him much changed.”</p>

<p>“He is much changed indeed,” replied Mr. Eardley;
“for to poor Bolder suffering has not been sent in vain.
He used to look around him for subjects of censure, now
he has learned to look within; and what he did before
to be honoured of men, he does now for the sake of his
God. Human nature regards sickness and pain as enemies;
but it is through such enemies that a message of
love and mercy has come to Bolder.”</p>

<p>“And little Lottie Stone, my first acquaintance in
Wildwaste, how fares she?” asked Arthur Madden.
“Methinks I see her now, in my mind’s eye, the gipsy-like
child, with her earnest black eyes, wrapped up in
the old scarlet cloak, and—why, surely, there is Lottie
herself!” he exclaimed, and calling to the coachman to
stop, Arthur Madden, as we have already seen, greeted
the young Stones with pleasure, which was more than
reciprocated by them.</p>

<p>With the young hope is buoyant, and the sense of
happiness keen. The sight of her benefactor living, convalescent,
looking bright and kind as ever, seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
Lottie’s warm young heart an earnest that, like her late
anxiety upon his account, all her other troubles would
soon pass away. Her mother would come back—her
father would live to be a blessing and comfort in his
home—her own character would be fully cleared—Miss
Gritton and her dear pastor would smile upon her again—and
Heaven would guard her sweet lady from taking
the infection of the fever. Mr. Eardley looked on that
beaming young face, and his reflection was much the
same as that of Isa had been, “There is no sense of guilt
weighing on the conscience of that child; truth and innocence
are written upon every feature.”</p>

<p>“If you, too, are going to the lecture, Lottie, we’ll
spare you the long walk,” said the smiling Lina.</p>

<p>“Yes; up with you, Lottie, beside the coachman,”
cried Arthur. “Steady will follow; I’ll be bound he’ll
be in time. I never knew him late at my class; he was
one on whom I could always depend.”</p>

<p>The few words of kindly praise called up a grin of
pleasure on the sun-burned face of the dull-witted but
true-hearted lad, who went plodding on his lonely way
almost as happy as his sister.</p>

<p>The rapid motion of the vehicle on which she was
mounted was very exhilarating to Lottie. She felt herself
metaphorically, as well as literally, lifted on high
from the dust, relieved from oppressive weariness, given
rest and enjoyment while at the same time borne swiftly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
onwards. When the carriage stopped at the honey-suckle
covered porch, Lottie sprang down from her lofty seat
light as a squirrel. She had no fear now of encountering
cold looks, suspicious glances, as groups from the neighbourhood
dropped into the meeting. Every eye was fixed
upon Arthur Madden; no one seemed to have a thought
but for him and his sister, so lately arrived from the
Holy Land. Lottie missed, indeed, amongst the throng
her young mistress and Rebekah Holdich, who were both
absent from fear of conveying infection; but her prayers
for them both rose now with a feeling of joyous confidence,
to which the poor girl had been a stranger since
making that promise of silence to Gaspar, which had been
the source of such pain and distress.</p>

<h3>LECTURE VI.—FAITH VICTORIOUS.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">We are to contemplate this evening, my friends,
in one of the most marvellous triumphs ever
granted to faith, a most striking emblem of
the victory of the gospel over the opposition
of earth and hell. We will first consider the
historical narrative before us: then see how in it is prefigured
the success attending the preaching of the apostles
and disciples of our Lord; and, finally, draw encouragement
for ourselves in our conflict against the Midianites
in our own souls.</p>

<p>Gideon, after returning to his camp, made immediate
preparations for a night attack upon the foe. But these
preparations were of a nature to cause surprise amongst
his three hundred devoted men. They were not to string
the bow or to grasp the keen sword; they were to go
forth into the midst of the armed multitudes of Midian
as sheep amongst wolves, without—as it seems—either<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
weapons of offence or armour for protection! Gideon
divided his little band into three companies, and he put
a trumpet into every man’s hand, with an empty pitcher,
and a lamp was placed within each pitcher. And the
leader said to his followers: “Look on me, and do likewise:
and, behold, when I come to the outside of the
camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do. When I
blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then
blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp,
and say, <i>The sword of the Lord and of Gideon</i>!”</p>

<p>So Gideon, and the three hundred men that were with
him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning
of the middle night watch, and they blew the trumpets,
and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.</p>

<p>Loud and terrible was the sound that thus startled the
hosts of Midian from their slumbers on that eventful
night—the blare of the trumpets, the crash of the vessels,
while suddenly the glare of a hundred waving torches lit
up the darkness! From this side and that side the
sound is echoed, the flash is reflected, while loud bursts
the shout that strikes terror into the Midianites’ souls,—“<i>The
sword of the Lord and of Gideon!</i>” Smitten with
panic, confused by the noise, dazzled by the glare, the
multitudes of Midian are but embarrassed by their own
numbers, they cannot distinguish friend from foe,—they
snatch up their weapons, indeed, and use them with
frantic vigour, but every man’s hand is turned against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
his own fellow—warriors strike right and left, but their
fierce blows fall on their own companions in arms! One
wild instinct to save life by flight possesses all that vast
host; men rush hither and thither with frantic speed,
careless of trampling over the corpses of countrymen,
comrades, brothers!</p>

<p>The chosen three hundred, the “forlorn hope” of
Israel, had thus, through the power of Israel’s God, discomfited
and put to flight the armies of the aliens; but
their brethren were to join in the pursuit. Warriors
gathered out of Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh, and
pressed hard on the flying foe. Gideon despatched messengers
throughout all Ephraim, calling on the men of
that neighbouring tribe to seize on the fords of Jordan,
to intercept the flight of the Midianites over the river.
His directions were obeyed; the warlike Ephraimites
joined in the effort to free their country from the foe;
they pursued Midian, and brought the heads of two of
its princes, Oreb and Zeeb, to Gideon on the other side
of the Jordan.</p>

<p>In the marvellous success granted to the efforts of a
handful of men who, strong in faith, though armed only
with trumpets to sound, and torches to display, we see
most clearly foreshadowed the triumph of the gospel in
the days of the apostles and their immediate followers.
The whole world lay in wickedness, shrouded in deep
moral darkness, like the hosts of Midian in night, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
the Saviour came down unto His own, to be despised
and rejected of men. Satan appeared to hold the human
race under a yoke which no effort could break. Rome,
that towered supreme amongst the nations, that held in
subjection even the chosen land of Israel, was wholly
given to idolatry. Incense offered to false gods rose from
unnumbered shrines, benighted myriads worshipped vain
idols in blind superstition. And what was the force
chosen by God to oppose, to discomfit the powers of
earth and of hell, to overthrow heathen altars, to raise
the banner of the Cross against Satan and his hosts,
against the kings and princes of this world? A little
band of apostles and disciples—a few fishermen and
their companions—mostly poor, mostly unlearned, were
to engage in this the most mighty struggle which the
world had ever known! Not as the followers of Mohammed,
with the sword to sweep their enemies from
the earth; the early Christians had, as it were, like
Gideon’s men, their <i>torches</i> and their <i>trumpets</i>. The
trumpet, symbol of preaching,—the loud clear declaration
of the glorious truth that salvation is offered freely
to men through the blood of an incarnate God. <i>If the
trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare
himself to the battle?</i> saith the Apostle Paul, who himself
gave a blast, the echo of which still resoundeth
throughout the world! And the torches which these
early Christians displayed were the examples of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
pure and devoted lives—shining through, dispelling
the darkness around them, according to the word of
their Lord, <i>Let your light so shine before men, that
they may see your good works, and glorify your Father
which is in heaven.</i></p>

<p>But the treasure was borne in earthly vessels, and
those vessels were broken and shattered, that the light
might more clearly be seen. “The blood of martyrs
was the seed of the Church.” All the apostles, with
the single exception of St. John, who was persecuted
and banished, died a violent death for the sake of the
gospel. But their lights did not perish with them: no;
they were lifted on high to shine in glory, enlightening
generation after generation, with a brilliance which
shall never pass away. Thus was it that our religion
triumphed over the enemy by the flash of the torch and
the blast of the trumpet. The victory of Gideon was as
a rehearsal of the infinitely more glorious triumph of the
gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>And now, dear brethren, to apply to our consciences
the lesson before us, let us examine into the work of
faith and the power of faith in our own souls. What
do we know of conflict, what do we know of victory
over the Midianites in our hearts, even our own besetting
sins? Have we left those sins quietly in possession
to degrade and enslave our souls, or have we
sought to fight the good fight? If we have attempted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
to throw off the enemy’s yoke, how have we prepared
ourselves for the battle? Our own good resolutions,
our trust in our own strength, our pride of conscious
virtue, these may have been as the forces that gathered
at first around Gideon, but not to those are the victory
given. The triumph must be that, not of human
strength, but of God-bestowed <i>faith</i>. It was when St.
Paul, struggling with inward corruption, exclaimed, <i>O
wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the
body of this death?</i> that he was enabled to add, <i>Thanks
be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord
Jesus Christ</i>!</p>

<p>Again, the weapons with which we assault the enemy
in his camp may find their emblems in the torches and
trumpets carried by Gideon’s band. There is the loud
alarm of conscience, sounding clear and distinct in the
soul, giving no uncertain sound. There are the precepts
and promises of Scripture, scattering the darkness around—<i>Thy
Word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto
my path</i>; while often painful dispensations, the shattering
of human joys, the crash of the earthen vessels, make that
Word to shine to us with a brilliance unknown in the
days of our joy. But instead of the shout of Gideon,
the Christian’s voice is raised in prayer. It is the cry
to the Lord for help that puts the Destroyer to flight.
Thus may we discomfit our spiritual foes, <i>more than conquerors</i>
through Him that loved us,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“His grace our strength, our guide His word;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our aim, the glory of the Lord!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>How was it with the patriarch Abraham when his
faith had to endure one of the severest conflicts recorded
in Scripture,—when he was commanded to offer up the
son whom he loved? Dark was the night around him,
his natural affections were enlisted on the enemy’s side;
but conscience sounded the call to obedience, while faith
firmly grasped the promise, <i>In Isaac shall thy seed be
called</i>: so dashing down, as the earthen vessels were
dashed, any doubts or misgivings that would have obscured
the light of that promise, Abraham triumphed
because he believed, and received the reward of his
faith.</p>

<p>In such an instance as this, to return to the simile of
the tree, we see the ripe fruits of faith. The sun of
God’s grace has shone so brightly, the dew of His Spirit
has rested so fully upon it, that we behold it at length
in all its sweetness, richness, and beauty. Christian
brethren, be content with nothing short of this. We
see too many with whom it appears as if their graces
never would ripen. There is a crudeness, a hardness
about their religion, which, if it do not make us doubt
its nature, at least takes from it all its charm. Faith
cannot be fully developed where the softness of humility,
the sweetness of charity, are unknown. It is of the
man who not only yields obedience to the commandments,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
but delights in the law of the Lord, that it is
written, <i>He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of
water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his
leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth it
shall prosper</i>.</p>

<h3>BONDAGE.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-l.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Look at them out of the window! no, indeed!
If they are so anxious to see their sister after a
four years’ separation, let them come to her in
her chamber of sickness,” was Cora’s reply to an
affectionate message from the newly-arrived
travellers conveyed to her through Isa. “Since strangers
are not afraid of infection,” she continued with a
sneer, “it shows that the danger may be braved even by
those who have not, like Arthur Madden, a reputation
for heroic self-devotion.”</p>

<p>“Still the bitterness—still the satire: can trial and
sickness teach her nothing?” thought Isa, as she left the
room to send, in softened form, the ungracious message of
Cora to her brother and sister, who were waiting in front
of the house which they were forbidden to enter. Isa
had already explained to Cora how great would be to
Arthur the useless risk of a meeting, she had therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
felt it unnecessary to reply to a sarcasm which was at
once so ungenerous and unjust.</p>

<p>Cora, against the remonstrances of her gentle nurses,
had insisted on rising and dressing. She was impatient
of all restraint, and opposition only made her irritable.
The first moment that she found herself alone, she walked
up to the toilette-table and looked into the glass. For
several minutes Cora remained motionless, mutely staring
into the too faithful mirror, as if the frightful image
which it contained had the transfixing power of the Gorgon;
then she slowly turned from it, with her soul overflowing
with bitterness. Miss Madden had possessed a
certain share of good looks, which her vanity had magnified
into beauty; now all had passed for ever away. Time,
indeed, would remove much of the disfigurement which
made a once handsome countenance hideous, but Cora
knew too well that in her case time would never entirely
efface the marks left by the small-pox. Perhaps
no woman in Cora’s position would have been insensible
to a trial such as this, but to one who had sought all her
happiness from the world, to whom its smile had been
sunshine, the trial was well-nigh intolerable. The loss
of her personal attractions was to Cora a greater affliction
than that of her property had been. Therefore was it
that the heart of Cora was as a well of bitterness, full to
the brim and overflowing in rebellion against God, and
malice against her happier fellow-creatures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>And was there no gratitude towards the generous girl
who had not only drawn, as it were, a sponge over the
record of injuries past, but at the cost of a painful sacrifice
had acted the part of a sister towards her? Did no
feeling of tenderness arise in the bosom of Cora when
she looked on the bright lovely face which might so soon,
for her sake, be marred like her own? It might have
been so, even with Cora Madden, had she not chosen to
regard the conduct of Isa, as well as that of Gaspar, as
the result of interested calculation. “They knew well
enough,” she muttered to herself, “that once under
their roof they had me at an advantage. Isa lavishes
attentions on me as men pour water on gunpowder, when
they fear to be shattered by its explosion. It was folly
in me to consent to receive such hypocritical kindness;
I wish that I had driven at once to Axe. But I have
the wit to penetrate their designs, and the spirit to defeat
them.”</p>

<p>With this impression on her mind, Cora, on Isa’s re-entering
her apartment, at once addressed her in a tone
of formal politeness,—</p>

<p>“I shall also have to trouble you, Miss Gritton, with a
message to your brother. As soon as I have sufficient
strength to go downstairs, I shall request an interview
with Mr. Gritton, that we may come to an understanding
on the unpleasant subject which I mentioned to him in
my note. Doubtless,” continued Cora with a sarcastic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
smile, “he will be glad of an opportunity of showing me
with what a tender regard for my interests he, as my
agent, always has acted.”</p>

<p>Isa could make no reply; she did not trust herself
even to look at the countenance of Cora, but at once
quitted the room to convey the message to her brother.
Scarcely had the door closed behind her when the attention
of Cora was attracted by the sound of loud cheers
rising from the direction of the little school which had
been built by Arthur in Wildwaste, the manly voices
of workmen blending with the shriller huzzas of the
young.</p>

<p>“What can the idle villagers be shouting for?” said
Cora to herself as she approached the window, and, concealing
herself behind the muslin curtain, looked down on the
scene below. She saw the whole population of Wildwaste—men,
women, and children—gathered around an
open carriage to welcome back the benefactor of all.
Even old Bolder, forgetful of his infirmities, had dragged
himself into the sunshine, to greet with hearty joy the
friend of the poor. Cora caught a glimpse of the face of
her brother, beaming with pure happiness, as he bent forward
to recognize familiar faces in the crowd. Cora
turned away with an expression of scorn on her lip, but
a pang of envy at her heart. To whom would her presence
bring joy? from whom could she look for welcome,
either in this world or in the next? She had dwelt, like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
her brother, near Wildwaste; she had enjoyed the same
opportunities as Arthur of instructing the ignorant and
feeding the hungry. He had helped the poor—she had
despised them; he had found his happiness in doing his
Master’s will—she had sought hers in following her own.
<i>Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the
upright in heart</i>; but on all that Cora had most prized
was the mournful sentence inscribed, <i>Vanity of vanities,
all is vanity</i>. Malice, worldliness, and pride now tormented
the soul of Cora; these spiritual foes had come to
her first as the Midianites to Israel in the time of Moses,
not to alarm but to seduce. She had welcomed and harboured
the tempters till they remained as masters and
tyrants within: she now felt their yoke to be galling
indeed.</p>

<p>The spirit of Gaspar Gritton was also acutely sensible
at this time of the degradation of its bondage. The idea
of the approaching interview with Miss Madden oppressed
him with a humiliating feeling of fear. Nor was Gaspar
free from care on the account of his sister. Isa’s gentleness
and unselfishness had had their natural effect in
thawing that cold ungenial heart, and an undefined terror
arose in it that he might, by pursuing his own interests,
have sacrificed the life of the only being on earth whom
he loved.</p>

<p>“Isa, you do not feel ill?” said Gaspar that evening
to his sister, whom he had been for some time watching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
in anxious silence. Isa was sitting in the study, apparently
engaged in reading, but it was long since she
had turned the page; her head was leaning on her hand,
a vivid colour was on her cheek, but her appearance
denoted languor and weariness, and, when Gaspar
spoke, her large soft eyes had heavily closed, as if for
slumber.</p>

<p>“No, not exactly ill,” replied Isa, with a languid
smile; “I have but a little headache, and feel as if I
wanted rest.”</p>

<p>“God grant that you have not taken the infection!”</p>

<p>“I was just thinking that if I should take it—and it is
very possible that I may do so—it would be well for me
to speak a few words to you before we are separated by
illness or—or that in which illness might end.” Isa had
been silently praying for courage to make one effort more—it
might be the last—to persuade her unhappy brother
to act a just and honourable part. “I have told you
our father’s last commands, oh, let me join to them a sister’s
entreaties. Gaspar, act towards Cora Madden as
you will wish that you had acted when you both stand
before the judgment-seat of God.” Isa spoke with emotion,
and the feverish flush on her cheek grew brighter
than before.</p>

<p>“What would you have me do?” asked Gaspar, in a
low, agitated voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>“What conscience bids, what God’s Word directs,” replied
Isa,—“make restitution.”</p>

<p>Gaspar rose and strode once or twice up and down the
apartment with his hands behind him; his brow furrowed
with an anxious frown. Presently he stopped
short before his sister, whose soul was rising in silent
supplication for her tempted brother.</p>

<p>“Isa, you ask too much. To refund that money would
be to acknowledge that it never ought to have been
mine.”</p>

<p>“But how will you then dare to meet face to face
with one whom, I fear, you have wronged?”</p>

<p>“I’ll not meet Cora Madden—I’ll leave this place—I’ll
go abroad!” said Gaspar hurriedly, giving voice to a
thought which had often recurred to his mind.</p>

<p>“And leave me?” cried Isa reproachfully.</p>

<p>“You will be with relations who care for you; you
will be in the Castle, or—;” Gaspar stopped short, for a
terrible thought flashed across him as he looked at the
drooping form of his sister, that she might find a yet
safer resting-place from sorrow and disgrace in the
grave.</p>

<img src="images/illus22.jpg" width="500" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ISA’S LAST APPEAL TO HER BROTHER.</p>
</div>

<p>Startled by the idea, as by a spectre, Gaspar insisted
on Isa’s at once retiring to seek the rest which she
needed. She lingered, from the feeling that she might
not be able to rise in the morning; that the languor and
pain which she felt might be signs that the fatal fever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
was already in her veins. Isa could not leave Gaspar
without one more appeal to the tempted one, whom—a
secret foreboding voice seemed to whisper—she was now
for the last time addressing. Isa returned back from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
door to the spot where her brother was seated, softly laid
her hand on his shoulder, pressed her feverish lips on his
brow, and then murmured, “O Gaspar, fly not from
duty! Whither can we go without having God and our
conscience still beside us?” After uttering this last
warning, she hastily quitted the room.</p>

<h3>THE NIGHT.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-o.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">“O my Lord, do Thou direct and bless us. I cast
all my cares upon Thee.” It was with this
prayer in her heart that Isa laid her aching
head on her pillow on that night. Cares had
thickened around her: the danger of disease,
disfigurement, perhaps an early death, was looming
before her, yet Isa was not unhappy. Though scarcely
able to frame a connected prayer, never had the maiden
approached the mercy-seat with more childlike confidence
than she did now. As the Christian goes from strength
to strength, Isa’s late victory over malice, resentment,
and self-will, had left a sweet sense of repose in the love
and the wisdom of God. Isa had risked her happiness
for the sake of conscience; or rather, she had placed her
happiness in the hands of her Lord, where she felt it to
be safer than in her own. He would guard her from
sickness, suffering, and sorrow, or bless her in the midst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
of them all. God had given her—of this Isa now felt a
sweet assurance—the heart of one whose affection to her
outweighed the world. Even if it were God’s will that
she should not again on earth meet her Henry, the union
of those who are one in Christ is not for this life alone.
Isa, and him whom she loved, had alike given themselves
unreservedly to their Lord: in life or in death they
were His, and no really good thing would their heavenly
Father withhold from His children. Isa’s faith had
greatly ripened during the last few days. She felt the
sunshine on her soul—she felt the refreshing dew of
God’s grace; and a mellowed sweetness was the result—while
peace mantled her soul like the soft down on the
peach, from whose surface the drops from the bursting
thunder-cloud trickle harmlessly away.</p>

<p>Very different was it with the unhappy Gaspar. Little
rest was to be his during that night. He was in an
agony of irresolution: Isa’s words had not been without
their effect. Sometimes he resolved to meet Cora with
an open confession, and throw himself on her generosity
to shield his character from reproach, while he made all
the reparation in his power for the injury which he had
done her. Then stronger than ever came the impulse to
fly the country. He had enough of property on the
premises to enable him to live in comfort in some part
of Europe where his antecedents would be unknown.
If he could not keep his plunder in England from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
grasp of the law, he would bear it thence, beyond reach
of loss or of shame. But would he be beyond the
avenging arm of Divine Justice? Might not that arm
be raised at that very moment to smite him in the
person of his sister; to make her—the pure, the innocent,
the generous—a victim for the crime of her
brother?</p>

<p>The sound of footsteps in the sick-room above him
made Gaspar restless and uneasy: prognostications of
evil disturbed him. When he fell at length into a state
of slumber, through his dreams sounded the measured
toll of the death-bell: a funeral seemed moving slowly
before him, the black plumes of the hearse nodding over
the white-bordered pall. Gaspar awoke with a start of
terror, raised himself on his elbow, and gazed around
him. To his disordered fancy, it seemed as if the light,
which was always kept in his chamber at night, were
burning blue; the shadows which it cast on ceiling and
wall took strange shapes, which appalled him, he knew
not why. The dimly-seen portrait of his father above
the mantelpiece seemed to Gaspar to look on him with
stern and threatening eyes: as he gazed, he could fancy
that they moved, and, wild as he knew the fancy to be,
the idea made him strangely shiver.</p>

<p>Hark! was there not a moving of bolts and bars in
the study adjoining, and a stealthy footstep heard on
the creaking floor? Had Gaspar’s secret been betrayed?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
Attracted by rich hoards of plunder, were robbers entering
the house? Mr. Gritton strained his ear and listened;
till at length, unable longer to endure uncertainty,
he started up from his couch and opened the door which
divided his sleeping-room from the study. All there
was perfectly dark, perfectly still: if there had been any
sound, it must have been but caused by the night wind
shaking the shutters or moaning under the door. Gaspar
could not, however, return to his bed: he dressed, and,
as he did so, marvelled to find his fingers trembling as if
from palsied age.</p>

<p>Taking his candle to light him, Gaspar then proceeded
to the vault which contained his treasure. He had perhaps
no very definite purpose in visiting it, except that
of removing a small sum required for household expenses;
yet there was a floating idea in his mind of ascertaining
how large a sum in gold he could convey away packed
in so small a space as not to excite suspicion. Lottie’s
accidental discovery of the vault had made her master
more than usually on his guard against betraying his
secret to others. He therefore carefully closed the trap-door
behind him before descending the ladder, and as
carefully closed the door which divided the outer vault
from the inner, when he had entered the latter, the
treasure-cave of his wealth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus23.jpg" width="500" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GASPAR AMONGST HIS TREASURES.</p>
</div>

<p>There stood the miser, in the midst of his hoards of
silver and gold—a lonely, miserable man. Those bags<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
heavy with coin, won at the price of conscience and
honour, had no more power to give peace to his soul
than their hard, cold contents could afford nourishment
to his frame. The place felt damp, the air oppressive.
A deathly chill came over Gaspar Gritton. He had
strange difficulty in unfastening the string round one of
his canvas bags. His fingers shook violently as he did
so: he overthrew the heavy bag, and had a dull perception
that money was clinking and falling and rolling
around him in every direction. Gaspar stooped with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
vague intention of picking it up, but was utterly unable
to find or even to see the coin; and equally impossible
was it for him to regain his former standing posture.
A strange numbness came over the unhappy man:
thought and feeling were alike suspended, and he lay for
hours in a senseless state on the damp, brick-paved floor,
besprinkled with gold.</p>

<p>Some degree of consciousness returned at last; but it
was that strange consciousness which may exist in a
trance of catalepsy, such as that which now enchained
the faculties of Gaspar Gritton. He lay as one dead, in
the position in which he had fallen, unable to stir a
muscle or to utter a sound—unable to give the smallest
outward sign of life. And yet the mind was awake,
alive to the horrors of his situation. Gaspar was buried
in the midst of his treasures, in the living grave which
he had so carefully prepared, so jealously concealed.
Men would search for him, and never find him. But
would they even search? Gaspar recalled with anguish
the intention of sudden flight which he had expressed to
his sister. She who cared for him—she who loved him—she
who, under other circumstances, would never have
rested until she had found him—would naturally conclude
from his own words that he had fled from fear of
exposure, and would not even make an attempt to discover
the place of his retreat. It would never be discovered
till perhaps ages hence, when the edifice above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
had crumbled away—the foundations might be dug up,
and a nameless skeleton found surrounded by heaps of
money and treasures of silver plate. Gaspar had meditated
flying from duty, and stern judgment had arrested
him on the threshold. In the gloomy, silent vault the
sinner was left alone with God and his conscience. The
candle which Gaspar had brought with him burned
down, flickered in the socket, went out. All was darkness,
all silence, all horror! It was as if the fearful
sentence had already been passed upon him who had
been enslaved by the love of money,—<i>Your gold and
silver is cankered, and the rust of them shall be a witness
against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were
fire; ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.</i></p>

<h3>A SISTER’S VOICE.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-l.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Lottie had not been alarmed by not hearing
from her mother, well knowing that, though
Mrs. Stone was able to read, she had never
penned a letter in the course of her life.
Lottie talked cheerfully and hopefully to
Steady on the evening following that on which the last
meeting had been held, as they sat together by the little
window after the work of the day was over.</p>

<p>“Now that Mr. Arthur has come back, it do seem as
if everything were a-brightening,” said she. “He’s getting
over his sickness wonderful, and I don’t believe as
father’s was ever half so bad. Father will be a-coming
home too; and Mr. Arthur will speak a word for him—I’m
sure that he will—and get him work at the factory
again, or maybe at the Castle. Mother won’t need to
work so hard, and we’ll have a nice little cottage of our
own, and not have to live in a lodging over a shop.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<p>Brightly glowed the reflection of the setting sun on
the windows of the opposite side of the street; and
Lottie’s black eyes, as she gazed on it, seemed to have
caught the cheerful gleam. But even as she looked, the
sun sank below the western horizon, the ruddy light
gradually faded away, and the gray hue of twilight succeeded.</p>

<p>“There be mother!” suddenly exclaimed young
Stone, rising quickly from his seat, as with weary step
a lonely woman turned the corner of the street, bending
as if under a heavy burden of years or sorrow, and never
once lifting her drooping eyes towards her home as she
approached it.</p>

<p>“Mother—alone! Oh, where—where has she left
father?” exclaimed Lottie, starting up and running to
meet her.</p>

<p>Deborah found the door open, and Lottie there with a
look of eager inquiry on her face. But no word was
uttered; for the sight of her mother’s countenance, and
the scraps of shabby mourning which she wore, took
from the young, warm-hearted girl all power of speech.
She followed Deborah upstairs, thankful that Mrs. Green
chanced to be at the moment out of the way.</p>

<p>“How’s father?” asked the son, who had met his
mother on the staircase.</p>

<p>Deborah made no reply, but entered the room, sank
wearily on a chair, and buried her face in her hands.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
She was a woman who seldom wept; but now her whole
frame shook with convulsive sobs. Lottie knelt down
beside her, looking up with anxious grief and fear into
her mother’s face. She could with difficulty catch the
meaning of Mrs. Stone’s scarcely articulate words:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus24.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE MOTHER’S RETURN.</p>
</div>

<p>“Thank God, at least I was in time to see him, to be
with him, at the last!”</p>

<p>Then the widow raised her head, stretched out her
arms, and drew sobbing to her heart her two fatherless
children.</p>

<p>Yes, the long-cherished dream of hope was over; the
erring husband—forgiven, loved, and watched for—had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
returned to his native shore to die. Stone had seen his
injured wife, and breathed his last sigh in her arms.
Had he died a penitent? Deborah fondly clung to the
hope; and when she had a little regained her composure,
repeated to her children again and again every faintly-breathed
sentence from the lips of the dying man that
could possibly be deemed an expression of penitence or
an utterance of prayer. Who could have borne to have
quenched her hope, or who would dare to say that the
daily supplication of wife and children for a wandering
sinner had not been answered at last?</p>

<p>As Deborah had hardly had one hour’s uninterrupted
sleep during the preceding week, she was almost overpowered
by physical weariness as well as by mental distress;
and Lottie had little difficulty in persuading her
to go to bed at once. This was the poor widow’s only
place of refuge from the intrusion of her neighbours; for
no sooner was it noised through Axe that Mrs. Stone
had returned home after attending the death-bed of her
husband, than some impelled by sympathy, some by
mere curiosity, visited her humble lodging, tormenting
the weeping Lottie with questions, or well-meant attempts
at offering consolation. She was thankful to close the
door at last upon all, and with a very heavy heart prepare
to go herself to rest.</p>

<p>“Shall we have just a bit of a prayer together, Steady,
as we always have?” said the poor girl, with a faltering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
voice. It had been the habit of the brother and sister
thus to pray, from the time when they had knelt as
children together in their cottage home at Wildwaste,
perhaps to be startled from their knees by the noisy
entrance of a parent reeling home from the ale-house.
Steady was very quiet, almost stolid; he had had no outburst
of sorrow on hearing of the death of his father;
perhaps those miserable days at Wildwaste had left
deeper memories on a mind more slow to receive or to
part with impressions; he had certainly never been
buoyed up with the same joyous hopes as his sister had
been, and was therefore less sensitive to disappointment.
The lad knelt down without reply, leaving, as usual, to
Lottie the uttering of the simple prayer, to which he
was wont to add the closing Amen.</p>

<p>“Pray God bless and keep dear—;” Lottie could go
no further. Alas! who has not felt how the first omission
of a dear familiar name in prayer brings vividly to
the soul of the mourner the reality of that separation,
which, as regards this world, is softened by no hope.
Lottie could only sob, while her brother, slowly and
very briefly, concluded the little prayer.</p>

<p>Lottie rose on the morrow with the feeling that there
was a great blank in her life; and yet it was not in the
nature of things that she should sorrow as long and as
deeply for such a parent as Abner had been, as for one
who had faithfully fulfilled the duties of husband and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
father. She resolved to devote herself more than ever
to her mother; and was almost glad, for her sake, that
she herself had been obliged to leave Wildwaste. The
return of Arthur and Lina Madden from Palestine had
diverted the attention of gossips from the subject of
Lottie’s mysterious sovereigns, and as it was widely
known that she had been seen on the box of a carriage
in which not only Arthur but Mr. Eardley had been
seated, slander itself was forced to own that “the gentlefolk,
anyways, seemed to know as how Lottie had come
honestly by that money; though ’twas a pity, it was,
that she made such a mystery about it.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon the unwelcome step of Mrs. Green
was heard on the stair. It was her third visit on that
day to the widow’s little room, as she had twice before
bustled up “just to see if she could do nothing for the
poor soul,” as she said, but in reality to pick up scraps
of gossip to retail to the baker’s sisters and the linen-draper’s
wife. This time, however, Mrs. Green came up
eager to impart news rather than to hear it. Unceremoniously
seating herself in the darkened room of sorrow
in which were the newly-made widow and her
fatherless girl, she said to Lottie, who was preparing the
simple afternoon meal, “I say, Lottie Stone, I think
that there new house at Wildwaste is somehow bewitched!
Here’s you a-running away from it, you can’t
or you won’t say why; and now there’s its own master<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
suddenly disappeared, and no one knows what’s become
of him.”</p>

<p>“Disappeared!” echoed Lottie, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Ay; no one’s seen nothing of him since last night,
and all Wildwaste’s in a commotion. He’d been to bed,
too, that was clear; and no one saw him leave the house
in the morning; and Hannah says that she could take
her oath that the chain was up on the house-door when
she went to it at seven. But Mr. Gritton’s not in the
Lodge; it’s been searched from top to bottom.”</p>

<p>“He’s been lost in the bog—like that miserable Dan
Ford,” said Deborah, gloomily.</p>

<p>“No, not that,” replied Mrs. Green; “the bog’s not
in a dangerous state just now; we’ve had so much hot
sunshine, that you might ride a horse across the common
from one end to the other.”</p>

<p>“Is my dear lady much frightened about her brother?”
asked Lottie, who had been listening with breathless interest.</p>

<p>“Not half so much frightened as one might expect,
Hannah says; nor half so much surprised at his disappearing.
It seems as if she’d a notion where he has
gone, though she does not choose to tell what she knows.
But Miss Gritton ain’t very well, they says; depend
on’t, she’s in for the fever. There’s nothing in the
world so catching as small-pox.”</p>

<p>Lottie’s heart sank within her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<p>“Mrs. Bolder thinks,” continued Mrs. Green, “that
Mr. Gritton has just gone off to Lunnon to be out of the
way of infection; but it’s odd enough that he should
have gone away without his hat, for that’s hanging up
in the hall; and its odder still that he should have been
pulling about the furniture like a madman. Hannah
told Mrs. Bolder, though she did not say a word of it to
trouble Miss Gritton, that she found the study in strange
disorder—the table pulled out of its place, the very
drugget rolled up!”</p>

<p>Lottie was hardly able to stifle the sudden exclamation
which rose to her lips.</p>

<p>Having unburdened herself of her news, Mrs. Green
suddenly remembered that her kettle would be boiling
over, and bustled out of the room. Lottie waited impatiently
for a few seconds, till she was certain that the
landlady was out of hearing, and then with energy
exclaimed, “Mother, mother, I must be off to Wildwaste;
I’m sure and certain I’m wanted.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you ever left your good place there,
Lottie; maybe they would not take you back now,”
said Deborah sadly. As Lottie had had the small-pox
in her childhood, her mother did not fear her catching
the complaint.</p>

<p>“Whether they will take me back or not, mother, I
must go,” said Lottie emphatically; “master’s lost—maybe
I’ll find him!” and hurriedly, as if every moment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
were precious, she took down from their peg her straw-bonnet
and cloak.</p>

<p>“It’s getting on in the day, my child, and a walk to
Wildwaste is a deal too long for you now. To-morrow
I’ll get the baker to take you in his cart—at least a
good bit of the way.”</p>

<p>Lottie clasped her hands with a look of anxious entreaty.
“Don’t stay me, mother, don’t stay me. If
Wildwaste were twice as far off, I’d walk all the same.
I can’t stop till to-morrow; I should not close an eye all
the night!”</p>

<p>Deborah had never before known her young daughter’s
mind so resolutely bent upon any course; she saw that
some very urgent motive indeed was drawing Lottie
towards Wildwaste. She believed this motive to be
affection towards her young mistress, and gave up opposing
the wishes of her child; only insisting on her taking
with her a small bundle of clothes, and refreshing herself
by a cup of tea before she started. In less than a
quarter of an hour Lottie was hastening on her way towards
Wildwaste.</p>

<p>“It’s all clear to me,” murmured the girl to herself,
as she rapidly walked along the street; “master has
gone down into that dismal place to look after his money,
and somehow he has locked himself in and cannot get
out; and no one thinks of looking for him there; and
so he’ll be starved to death, or maybe go right mad in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
that horrible vault. Hannah is hard of hearing—if he
called ever so loud she’d never hear him in the kitchen;
and my lady is upstairs, so his voice would never reach
her. It makes one’s blood cold to think of his trying to
get help, and shouting and calling, and never a soul going
near him! I must go and tell those who are searching
where to look.” Lottie had been walking very fast,
but she slackened her pace as a difficulty occurred to her
mind. “But I must not tell any one of that vault—no,
not even Miss Isa; have I not solemnly promised to
keep the secret? I must go down myself all alone to
that gloomy place. But what if master should be hiding
there on purpose; or if some one should come on a sudden
and find me down there amongst all the silver and
gold, might I not be taken for a thief? I have suffered
so much already, I could not abide any more of these
cruel suspicions; and maybe I’d be sent to prison this
time, and that would break mother’s heart altogether.”
The simple girl was so much startled by the images of
terror called up by her excited fancy, that for a moment
she felt inclined to turn back. “Suppose I tell Miss
Isa—only Miss Isa; that would keep my character clear;
and it cannot do harm for her to know where her own
brother hoards all his money. But that promise—that
fatal promise! What would the Lord have me to do?
It is so miserable to be able to ask advice of no one, not
even of my own dear mother! I seem going right into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
the darkness—but then, as Mr. Eardley would say, I’ve
the trumpet of conscience, and the light of the Word,
and the Lord Himself will guide me, and make me
triumph over all difficulties, if I put my firm trust in
Him. It seems so wonderful that the glorious King of
Heaven should think of or care for a poor ignorant child
like me!”</p>

<p>The shades of evening were gathering around her
before the weary Lottie trod the well-known path over
the common that led to Wildwaste Lodge. She looked
up anxiously at the windows as she approached the
house; she was uneasy regarding the health of her dear
young mistress. When Hannah, after tedious delay,
answered Lottie’s timid ring at the door-bell, her first
anxious question was, “Oh, tell me, how is Miss Isa?”
Lottie had to repeat it, for the old servant seemed more
deaf, as well as more ill-tempered than usual.</p>

<p>“She has a headache—natural enough, turning herself
into a sick-nurse for a stranger as gives more trouble
than thanks. And she’s a worritting after master, who
has disappeared, no one knows how. But what brings
you back, like a bad halfpenny, Lottie?” added the
peevish old woman; “you chose to take yourself off
without warning, leaving all the work of the house on
my hands, and now you may just keep away—there’s
no one as wants you here!” and Hannah almost shut
the door in the face of the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>“Let me in—for just this night—oh, let me in.
I’ve walked all the six miles from Axe; I can’t go back
in the dark all alone!” pleaded Lottie, whose brow and
lip were moist with toil-drops, and who felt the absolute
necessity of searching the vault without the delay of
another hour. “Hannah, I’ll work like a slave; I’ll
do anything that you bid me; just speak a word for
me to my mistress, pray her to let me stop, at least—at
least till the morning.”</p>

<p>“How can I be worritting Miss Isa, with asking any-think
for the like of you,” said Hannah ungraciously,
opening the door, however, a little wider, so as to give
admittance to Lottie. “You may go there into the
kitchen—everything there wants cleaning and looking
arter, for not a minute have I had to myself this blessed
day, what with the fetching and carrying upstairs,
downstairs, and all the stir about master, which has
turned the house upside down. There—you get water
from the pump, and fill the kettle, and wash up the
plates, while I go up with the medicine; there’s Miss
Madden’s bell ringing like mad!”</p>

<p>Lottie retired to the kitchen, but neither to rest nor
to work. After listening for a few moments to the
slow step of the old servant as she mounted the stairs,
grumbling at every step, the girl seized her opportunity,
and darted into the study. The table had not been
drawn back to its place, the brown drugget lay as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
Gaspar had left it; but though Lottie knew the situation
of the trap-door in the floor, she could not at once
discover it, either owing to the opening being so well
concealed, or from her own nervous haste causing confusion
in her mind. Having at last, rather by feeling
than by sight, found the portion of the planks that
could be moved, Lottie lifted the trap-door and again
timidly gazed down into the darkness below. Before
she ventured to descend she paused and listened, to
make certain that Hannah was still upstairs. She
heard the woman’s heavy step in the room above, and
then, feeling that every minute was precious, Lottie
hastily descended the ladder. Not having brought a
light with her, and the vault being utterly dark, the
girl had to grope to find the handle of that inner door
which Gaspar had closed, but not locked, behind him.
Lottie pressed against the door, but felt that something
within resisted her efforts to push it open. She used
more strength, pressing with knee and shoulder; the
resisting body, whatever it might be, yielded a little
under her efforts. There was an opening sufficiently
wide to admit the girl’s hand. Lottie sank on her
knees, and put down her hand in order to feel what was
the nature of the obstruction which the darkness prevented
her from seeing, and uttered a shriek of horror
upon touching a clammy human face! A frightful conviction
flashed on her mind that her master had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
murdered for his money, and that it was his corpse
which lay within the vault.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ve killed him!” she exclaimed aloud in
accents of terror, starting to her feet, as she uttered the
exclamation of fear.</p>

<p>“Killed whom?—in mercy speak!” cried the agonized
voice of Isa from above. Miss Gritton had chanced to
enter the study in search of some papers, and was with
astonishment bending over the open trap-door, when she
caught the sound of the terrible words from below. Isa
could scarcely see the top rounds of the ladder, so obscure
had the twilight become; she knew not whither it
might lead, or what horrors might lie at the bottom,
yet she hesitated not for one instant, and almost before
the sound of her terrified question had died away, she
was at the side of Lottie in the utter darkness of the
vault.</p>

<p>“Master has been murdered!” gasped the young
maid. Gaspar could hear her exclamation distinctly,
but was unable to speak a word in reply.</p>

<p>“Gaspar—O my brother!” cried Isa, in a tone of
piercing distress.</p>

<p>That cry from the lips of a sister broke the spell of
the strange trance with which Gaspar Gritton had been
bound. During all the long hours of his terrible imprisonment
he had been unable to stir or to make the
least sound; and though he was conscious of Lottie’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
presence when she touched him, and could hear her
voice, he had still remained as it were dead, helpless as
a corpse in his living grave. But to Isa’s call, to his
inexpressible relief, Gaspar was able to answer; the
hitherto paralyzed limbs stirred with life, and with a
murmured “God be praised!” he awoke from what
appeared to him like a dream of unutterable horror.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus25.jpg" width="500" height="425" alt="" />
<p class="caption">FOUND IN THE VAULT.</p>
</div>

<p>But Gaspar’s powers were in a very feeble state; he
was unable at first even to move far enough from the
door which divided him from his sister for it to be opened
sufficiently wide to admit of her passing through.</p>

<p>“Oh, for a light!” exclaimed Isa; then hearing
Hannah’s step in the study above, she called out loudly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
“Bring light—help—quick, quick—your master’s dying
down here in the vault!”</p>

<p>Some minutes of terrible anxiety followed; Isa dreaded
to see what light might reveal, for the idea of murder,
first suggested by Lottie, was uppermost in her mind.
Hannah had rushed towards the hamlet to summon aid;
Isa sent Lottie up the ladder for a light; the girl had
hardly procured it when the hall of the Lodge was filled
with a party of workmen, whom Hannah’s loud call for
assistance had brought to the house.</p>

<p>By the help of the men’s strong arms, Mr. Gritton
was carried up from his gloomy prison-vault, and laid
on his bed. Thankful indeed was Isa to find that her
brother was unwounded, and apparently unhurt, though
in a very weak and nervous condition. She neither
questioned him, nor suffered him to be questioned, but
she marked the glances of surprise and suspicion exchanged
between the workmen, who had seen what
they were never designed to see, and learned what they
were never intended to know. Gaspar’s secret was a
secret no longer, except as regarded his way of acquiring
the hoards of treasure, of which an exaggerated
account spread through all the hamlet before the
morning.</p>

<p>Having thanked, rewarded, and dismissed the workmen,
Isa sat for hours watching by her brother, and
listening to a confession from his lips which filled her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
heart with mingled grief, shame, thankfulness, and
hope.</p>

<p>There are some men whom judgments only harden—a
thunderbolt might shatter, but it never would melt
them—Gaspar’s nature resembled not such. He felt on
that solemn night much as Dives might have felt had
his tortured spirit received a reprieve, and been permitted
once more to dwell upon earth. He had been
given a glimpse, as if by the lurid light of the devouring
flame, of the utter worthlessness of all for which
man would exchange his immortal soul. The impression
might become weakened by time, but upon that night
it was strong. Gaspar unburdened his soul to his
sister; he told her all, even to Lottie’s discovery of the
treasure, and besought Isa’s counsel in the difficult strait
into which his covetousness had brought him.</p>

<p>Confession—reparation! From these Gaspar shrank,
as the patient from the knife of the surgeon. Could no
milder remedy be found, could there be no compromise
with conscience? Isa dared suggest none, though she
would have given all that she possessed on earth to save
her brother from the bitter humiliation of acknowledging
to Cora Madden the base fraud which he had committed.
The strength of Isa’s faith and obedience was
brought to painful proof on that night. If she had
yielded but a point, if she had counselled delay, if she
had administered an opiate to the tortured conscience of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
her brother, as all her tender woman’s nature, ay, and
all her woman’s pride, pleaded for her to do, Gaspar
would, like Felix, have put off the hated duty for a
more convenient season, and the precious moment for
action would have passed away for ever. But Isa had
the fear of God before her eyes; she had a keen perception
that this was a crisis in the spiritual life of her
brother, that his soul’s interests for eternity might hang
on the result of his decision on that night. Her voice
had aroused him from the death-like stupor of the body,
her voice was to be also the means of quickening the
lethargic soul. The whisper of delay in his case could
but be the breathing of the enemy who would lure him
to destruction. Isa reminded Gaspar of the resolution
of Zaccheus, when he had received the Lord into his
home and his heart: it was not “I will give,” but <i>I
give</i>; it was not “I will restore,” but <i>I restore</i>. Gaspar
was irresolute, undecided, but his good angel was beside
him to help his weak nature in the great mental conflict.
It was almost midnight before that trying interview
ended, and the brother and sister separated, the
one to sink into a troubled slumber, the other to return
to the chamber of Cora, intrusted by Gaspar with the
responsible and most painful charge of making for him
that humiliating confession which he himself had not
the courage to make.</p>

<h3>A TRIUMPH.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">With a very slow step, aching heart, and
knees that trembled beneath her, Isa reascended
the staircase. One apparently insuperable
difficulty had been overcome,—Gaspar
had consented to make full reparation.
Isa could feel thankful for this; but she had
now a breathing-space for consideration, and with inexpressible
repugnance she now recoiled from the task set
before her. It had been hard to banish from her heart
resentful emotions in regard to Cora; it had been hard
to Isa to receive an enemy into her home, to tend her
as a sister, to risk health and life in her service. But
there had been nothing to wound pride in all this; on
the contrary, Isa had stood in the elevated position of a
benefactress, as one enjoying the noblest kind of revenge
by repaying injuries with kindness. The consciousness
of this had brought a feeling of gratification. But her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
position was painfully altered now. Isa must humble
herself in the presence of a woman whom she neither
loved nor respected; she must, as the representative of
her brother, confess guilt—ask for forgiveness—plead
for mercy! Isa stopped half-way on the stairs, supporting
herself on the banister, for every fibre in her frame
was trembling with strong emotion. She had ventured,
as it were, to the outskirts of the camp of Midian, and
felt that she lacked courage to strike the final blow for
freedom. A silent cry for help arose to heaven from
the depths of a suffering heart.</p>

<p>Cora was one to whom it would be especially painful
to make a confession such as that which burdened the
soul of Isa. Miss Madden had been brought much into
contact with the world, had imbibed its spirit, and
adopted one of its most dangerous ideas,—namely, a disbelief
in the existence of faith as a ruling motive. Notwithstanding
the noble example of piety which she had
had before her in her own brother, Cora had persisted
in regarding all men as governed either by self-interest
or the love of approbation.</p>

<p>“Sir Robert Walpole said, and said truly,” Cora had
once lightly observed, “that every man has his price;
only some will have it told down in hard cash, and
others are quite contented with the paper-money of
praise.”</p>

<p>Thus Cora refused to see the reflected glory of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
Saviour in His people: however brightly their light
might shine, she believed that it was fed from an earthly
source, and eagerly caught at every instance of inconsistency
in the servants of God to confirm her theory
that they only wore piety as a mask, and, in fact, were
much the same with the show of religion as the rest of
the world were without it.</p>

<p>It was this fallacy more than anything else that had
hardened the heart of Cora, and made her justify herself
in her own indifference towards spiritual things.
She would draw down all to the same low level as herself,
and thus hope to escape condemnation in a crowd.
Cora’s chilling disbelief in the practical influence of faith
had been shaken when she had first been admitted into
the home of Isa Gritton while suffering from an infectious
complaint. The ice which the world had encrusted
round her heart had given some signs of melting. Then
the idea that the Grittons were, after all, only acting
from self-interest, had almost restored her frigid scepticism;
she would not recognize the reality and the
power of that faith which worketh by love. The
sudden and strange disappearance of Gaspar had confirmed
Cora in her impressions. “He flies me because
he fears me,” was the reflection of the proud woman;
and the insolence of her spirit had broken out even in
the presence of the anxious sister. “Perhaps Miss
Gritton has an idea not only whither, but for what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
cause, her brother had so suddenly vanished from this
neighbourhood,” had been Cora’s sneering remark.</p>

<p>And yet, with all her bitterness and worldliness of
spirit, Cora was capable of more generous feeling. She
was a woman, and, like a woman, could cherish disinterested
affection. Cora keenly felt her own isolation
in life, that isolation which she feared that her personal
disfigurement would now render perpetual. She had
cut herself off from the proffered affection of Arthur and
Lina; she had quarrelled with Lionel’s wife; she had
many acquaintances, but was painfully aware that she
had never made one true friend. Cora, especially
during her illness, had often yearned for the love of
a gentle, sympathizing heart, and something of gratitude,
something of admiration, had drawn her towards Isa
Gritton.</p>

<p>“How ill Miss Gritton looks to-night; I fear that she
is sickening for the fever,” Mrs. Holdich had observed,
on Isa’s quitting the room to go and search for papers in
the study, at the time when, as the reader knows, Lottie
was exploring the vault.</p>

<p>The observation had inflicted a sharp pang on Cora;
she was startled on realizing the possibility that Isa’s
life might indeed be given for her own, and a contrast
would suggest itself between the comparative value of
those lives. Isa, as Cora knew from Rebekah Holdich,
was the light of her brother’s home, the gentle benefactress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
of the poor, and, as Cora was at that very time
experiencing, a generous friend to those who needed
her aid. In her, more than in any one else, Cora had
caught a glimpse of the beauty of holiness; in her,
more than in any one else, Cora had been almost forced
to recognize the power of faith; and at that moment
the proud, cold woman felt that there was one being on
earth whom she could love, one whom she could not
endure to see fall a sacrifice to her generous kindness to
herself.</p>

<p>Cora’s bitter but salutary reflections were interrupted
by the noise and excitement below, which followed the
discovery of Gaspar Gritton in the vault. The loud
call of Hannah for assistance was distinctly heard in
the upper rooms occupied by Miss Madden; and Cora
sent down Mrs. Holdich in haste to ascertain the cause
of such an unusual disturbance. Rebekah did not return
for a considerable time, and Cora grew so impatient
that she could hardly restrain herself from hurrying
downstairs. Mrs. Holdich came at last with the information
that Mr. Gritton had been found in an insensible
state in a vault, that he had been removed to his own
apartment, and that his sister was carefully tending him
there. This was all which Cora could learn from Rebekah,
and it did not satisfy her thirst for information;
she determined not to retire to rest until she had seen
Isa Gritton. To beguile the time, Cora went up to Isa’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
little bookcase, hoping to find there some light reading
to amuse herself with. One volume, from the elegance
of its binding, attracted Miss Madden’s attention, and
she drew it forth from its place. It contained no work
of fiction, as Cora had hoped and expected, but a selection
of hymns. At another time Cora would have
replaced the book, with perhaps an expression of scorn;
but she was in a softened mood on that night, and her
eye was attracted by the marking and double-marking
on the margin of many of the pages. Chiefly from
curiosity, but possibly from a better motive, Miss Madden
carried the book to the place where she usually sat
on her soft-cushioned chair, seated herself, and began to
read in a desultory way.</p>

<p>One of the hymns which had been most strongly
marked by Isa was the well-known one commencing
with the line,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And dost thou say, Ask what thou wilt?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This hymn was an especial favourite with Isa, who knew
it by heart; but the proud, selfish woman who now
perused it, in the stillness of night and the seclusion of
a sick-room, seemed to be introduced into a new world
of sensation as she read the lines, which express a
Christian’s most fervent desire:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“More of Thy presence, Lord, impart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">More of Thine image let me bear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Enthrone Thyself within my heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And reign without a rival there.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Grant this request, I ask no more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But to Thy care the rest resign;—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sick, or in health, or rich, or poor,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">All shall be well if Thou art mine.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Can it be that any human being really feels this?”
thought Cora, half closing the volume. “I cannot believe
it. And yet Isa Gritton has acted as if she felt it.
But no, no—she is at this moment playing the part of
an accomplice of her money-loving brother. Her faith
may make her like such a book as this, mark it, perhaps
cry over it; it may give her that gentleness and kindliness
which have half won me over to love her in spite
of myself; it may—yes, it may possibly have some
effect in taking away the fear of losing beauty, or even
life; but when it comes to the question of its requiring
such integrity of conduct as would involve loss and disgrace,
faith will find it expedient to confine itself to
sentimental devotion, and the saint will come forth from
the closet to act in the world—as the children of the
world always act.”</p>

<p>A gentle hand noiselessly turned the handle of the
door, and Isa glided into the room. She was surprised
to see Cora still awake and sitting up at the midnight
hour.</p>

<p>“I thought that I should have found my patient
asleep,” she observed.</p>

<p>“I could not have slept till I had seen you; I wanted
to hear about your brother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<p>Isa rather sank than seated herself upon a chair; a
cold shiver ran through her frame; she knew not if the
overpowering sensations which oppressed her arose only
from the reaction after painful excitement, or if she were
indeed sickening for a terrible complaint.</p>

<p>“I may be delirious ere morning,” thought Isa; “I
must speak now, or I never may have power to speak.
May it not be deemed providential that I am given an
opportunity of confession by this midnight interview
with Cora!”</p>

<p>“Miss Gritton, you look sadly ill,” said Cora, with
more of sympathy than Isa had ever before heard in her
tone. “Are you very anxious regarding your brother?”</p>

<p>“I am very anxious indeed,” replied Isa faintly,
glancing at the closed door which divided the ladies
from the room in which Mrs. Holdich was resting, to be
sure that no ear but Cora’s should hear what she was
bracing up her courage to say. “Miss Madden, I have
come charged with a message to you from Gaspar.” Isa
paused, for she was very breathless; her heart fluttered—she
had a strange difficulty in articulating her words;
she dared not look up and meet the keen gaze which
she was certain was fixed upon her. “My brother
believes—feels sure—that there is no evidence which
could be produced in a court of law which could bring
home to him that—that of which you have been led to
suspect him.” Another very painful pause; Isa pressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
her hand to her side to still the throbbing of her heart.
“But,” she continued with an effort, “Gaspar knows—owns—that
though man cannot convict, there is a
higher tribunal than man’s, and before it he cannot
plead his innocence. It was indeed not your property
which was lost in the <i>Orissa</i>—your money is in the
hands of my brother, and shall be restored, principal and
interest; you shall have ample satisfaction as far as gold
can give it. And oh, Cora—Miss Madden—will not
this compensation suffice? will you not forgive all the
past, and spare the reputation of him who thus throws
himself on your indulgence? will you not shield from
reproach one who is ready amply to redeem the wrong
committed under strong temptation, and show your
generosity by burying this unhappy affair in silence and
oblivion?”</p>

<p>Isa clasped her hands as she spoke in the fervour of
her pleading; her eyes suddenly raised met those of Cora,
and to her surprise beheld them brimming over with tears.</p>

<p>Cora rose from her seat. “O Isa,” she exclaimed,
“fear nothing from me! Had the wrong been tenfold,
I have learned from you how to forgive—and much
besides!” And with a burst of emotion, which all her
pride could not restrain, Cora threw her arms around
Isa, who found herself, to her great astonishment, pressed
to the heart of one who had been her bitter, malignant
enemy.</p>

<p class="caption">THE CONFESSION.</p>
</div>

<p>The victories of faith are not only over inward foes:
when the ways of a man are pleasing to the Lord, He
maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. Isa,
in her gentleness and Christian sympathy, her uprightness,
her obedience to the call of duty, had done more
to lead her proud, erring heart to repentance than all
the sermons which had fallen on the ear of Cora like
seed on the trodden wayside. Cora had never realized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
how far she herself was from being a Christian, till she
had seen exemplified in one of her own sex and station
what a Christian should be. It was in the hour when
Isa felt humiliated, covered with shame for the errors of
a brother, that she had forced from proud lips that tribute
to her character which was in itself an acknowledgment
of inferiority such as no being had ever before
wrung from Cora Madden. Isa had won a noble triumph—she
had conquered the heart of her foe.</p>

<p class="dropcap">There was much excitement in Wildwaste relative
to the occurrences of that night. Various
rumours spread, with more or less of truth in
them, concerning Gaspar Gritton, and the
strange way in which he had been discovered lying in
a lifeless state in a mysterious vault full of treasure.
As Lottie was reinstated in her place, and Cora was
convalescent, the services of Mrs. Holdich were no
longer required; the steward’s wife—after changing her
infected garments—returned to her home, where she
was besieged by curious inquirers. Rebekah smiled at
the strange exaggerations which had spread around, like
widening circles on a lake into which a pebble has been
thrown. It was true, she said, that Lottie had performed
an important service, had been the means of
preserving her master’s life, for which she would be
liberally rewarded; but as regarded the vault and its
mysterious contents, Rebekah maintained a placid silence.
She had a note from Isa to convey to the Castle, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
which Arthur and Lina Madden were now residing as
the baronet’s guests. The result of that note was, that
Holdich appeared that afternoon at Wildwaste Lodge,
equipped for a journey to London, part of his equipment
being a pair of loaded revolvers. Crowds of workmen
and their families thronged before the Lodge, curiously
watching the door through which were borne iron boxes,
very heavy in proportion to their size, and believed to
contain treasures of plate and bullion sufficient to buy
up the village. With emotions of intense relief and
deep thankfulness Isa watched from the window the
departure of the cart for the station, with the sturdy
steward seated on one of the boxes within it, keeping
faithful watch over his dangerous charge. It was not
only because in that lawless part of the country the
Lodge would scarcely have been a safe residence when
known to contain a treasure, that Isa rejoiced in its
departure; it was because she looked on that ill-gotten
gold much as our ancestors looked upon the barrels of
gunpowder buried in a vault beneath Parliament-house
by an insidious and cruel foe. It had been placed there
not to enrich, but to destroy; not as a blessing, but a
curse;—<i>an enemy hath done this</i>. From the days of
Achan unto our own, there is a woe for him who heapeth
up riches unrighteously won.</p>

<p>No one from the Lodge appeared at the steward’s
cottage on that evening, and he himself was absent on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
his mission to London; but Edith Lestrange and her
guests came from the Castle to attend Mr. Eardley’s
closing lecture on the “Triumph over Midian.”</p>

<h3>LECTURE VII.—FAITH CROWNED.</h3>

<p>The men of Ephraim, as was mentioned at our last
meeting, had encountered some of the fugitives of Midian,
had slain two of their princes, and brought their heads
to Gideon. But the Ephraimites, men of a warlike
tribe, were angry at having been appointed but a
secondary part; they were indignant at the chief honour,
as well as the chief danger, of the struggle having been
assigned to Gideon’s three hundred heroes.</p>

<p>“Why hast thou served us thus,” they fiercely exclaimed
to the leader, “that thou calledst us not when
thou wentest to fight the Midianites?” They came full
of jealous resentment; and instead of rejoicing in the
triumph, chafed at not having sooner been permitted to
share it.</p>

<p><i>Only by pride cometh contention; with the lowly is
wisdom.</i> Gideon, humble in the midst of his marvellous
success, experienced the power of the soft answer to turn
away wrath. He said unto the indignant warriors,
<i>What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not
the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the
vintage of Abiezer? God hath delivered into your
hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then,
adds the sacred narrative, their anger was abated towards
him.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus27.jpg" width="500" height="525" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GIDEON AND THE EPHRAIMITES.</p>
</div>

<p>But it was not with the proud sons of Ephraim, but
with his own band, the chosen of God, that Gideon
completed his victory by following up the pursuit beyond
Jordan. They held a commission from the Most High,
and exchanging their trumpets and torches for weapons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
of war, <i>faint, yet pursuing</i>, they pressed on. Weary
and hungry were the brave warriors of Gideon; they
lacked refreshment to renew their failing strength, but
that refreshment was cruelly withheld, first by the men
of Succoth, and then by those of Penuel, from whom
Gideon had craved the much-needed supplies. These
inhabitants of Succoth and Penuel, sons of Israel unworthy
of the name, afterwards received the punishment
due for their indifference to a holy cause—their base
inhospitable neglect of those bearing the burden and heat
of the conflict.</p>

<p>And can we find none even in a Christian land whose
conduct closely resembles that of the men of Succoth
and Penuel? The missionaries of the Cross are engaged
in a long and arduous struggle to carry the banner of
their Lord into the strongholds of heathen error. They
are a small and, as regards numbers, a feeble band; they
need support and sympathy from those who dwell at
ease in their peaceful homes. For them their heavenly
Leader deigns to ask the aid of their brethren. In the
words of Gideon we seem to hear the Lord’s <i>Give, I pray
you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me, for
they be faint</i>. And how is that appeal received by the
greater number of those who call themselves Christians?
Some, indeed, rejoice to bring out their offerings; they
deem it an honour to be permitted to give from their
stores and refresh the fainting powers of those who are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
foremost in fighting the good fight of faith. To these
how sweet the Saviour’s promise to His disciples: <i>Whosoever
shall give you a cup of water to drink in My
name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto
you, he shall not lose his reward</i>.</p>

<p>But shall not the multitudes who give no aid to the
servants of God, who share the guilt of Penuel and
Succoth, fear to share their punishment also? It is lack
of faith that hardens the heart, that closes the hand;
for who could refuse to give—give largely, give to the
utmost of his power—if he really <i>believed</i> that at the
last day those who have turned a deaf ear to the appeal
of the weary, shall hear from the lips of the Eternal
Judge the terrible words, <i>Inasmuch as ye did it not to
one of the least of these, ye did it not to Me. Depart
from Me, ye cursed!</i></p>

<p>Faint, yet pursuing, Gideon and his band followed on
the track of Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.
These, with about fifteen thousand men who had escaped
from the slaughter which followed the sounding of the
trumpets, had reached Karkor, and believed themselves
there to be secure from further attack. <i>Faint, but pursuing.</i>
Thus, in his life-long warfare against sin, presses
on the Christian from grace to grace, till God receives
him to glory. He must not sheathe the sword of the
Spirit while one evil passion remains unsubdued; he
must not relax his efforts till the Almighty himself perfect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
the victory within him, and call him to inherit the
kingdom above. We may have much to discourage us,
much to try our courage and patience; it is not by one
effort, however great, that the yoke of Midian can be
broken, that faith can finally triumph over corruption
within. <i>Let patience leave its perfect work</i>; however
long and arduous may be the pursuit, God can uphold,
strengthen, and bless us, as in His name and for His sake
we struggle on, <i>faint, yet pursuing</i>.</p>

<p>Complete success crowned the efforts of Gideon. He
came up with the men of Midian, discomfited all their
host, and took captive their kings Zebah and Zalmunna.
As they were not of the doomed races of Canaan, the
leader of Israel would have spared these foes, had they
not been stained with the blood of his brethren, whom,
by the Midianites’ own confession, they had slain at
Tabor. Gideon was by law the avenger of this blood.
The sacred record gives us a striking glimpse of the way
in which justice was satisfied in that remote age—the
brief investigation, and the prompt execution by the
hand of the near of kin, according to the commandment of
Moses: <i>The murderer shall surely be put to death; the
revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer; when
he meeteth him, he shall slay him</i> (Num. xxxv. 18, 19).
Gideon inquired of Zebah and Zalmunna, “What manner
of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor?” evidently
alluding to some well-known act of violence. And the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
princes made answer, “As thou art, so were they; each
one resembled the children of a king.” And he said,
“They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother:
as the Lord liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would
not slay you.”</p>

<p>Gideon then commanded his first-born to fulfil the
stern duty of the avenger of blood; but the youth shrank
from the office. “Rise thou, and fall upon us,” cried
the bold sons of Midian to Gideon; “for as the man is,
so is his strength.” By the hand of their conqueror,
therefore, Zebah and Zalmunna met the fate which their
crimes had deserved.</p>

<p>The victories of Gideon, his great services rendered to
his country, had won for him the enthusiastic admiration
and gratitude of the people whom he had freed from the
enemy’s yoke. Nothing was deemed by his countrymen
too great a reward for the hero who had delivered them.
Let him who had saved Israel become the head of the
nation, the first of a dynasty of rulers. The men of
Israel said unto Gideon, “Rule thou over us, both thou,
and thy son, and thy son’s son also; for thou hast
delivered us from the hand of Midian.”</p>

<p>But Gideon’s had been the triumph of faith, not the
proud struggle of ambition. He desired no crown; he
would mount no throne; the Lord God of Hosts alone
should be the King of Israel. “I will not rule over
you,” said Gideon; “neither shall my son rule over you:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
the Lord shall rule over you.” It is to God alone that
belongeth the power and the glory; it was God who had
smitten down Midian, and Gideon, great in humility as
in his faith, gave the honour to God. Rich was the
blessing that followed, as recorded in the page of Scripture,
<i>Thus was Midian subdued before the children of
Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And
the country was in quietness forty years in the days of
Gideon.</i></p>

<p>We have seen in the history before us the tree of
faith budding, bearing fair blossoms, and then its fruits
gradually ripening into perfection. We now see, as it
were, those precious fruits gathered and laid as an offering
upon the altar of the Lord. The Saviour <i>shall come to
be glorified in His saints, and admired in all them
that believe</i>; the harvest is His, His servants lay its
treasures at His feet.</p>

<p>And what is the practical lesson, my brethren, left on
our minds by the record of the perils, the exploits, and
the success of Gideon? Can we trace in it any likeness
to the experience of our own soul? Have we received
the angel’s visit, heard the promise, obeyed the command?
Have we thrown down the idolatrous shrine in the spirit
breathed in the words of the poet,—</p>

<p class="noindent">Have we trusted to God alone to strengthen us for the conflict
with sin by the grace of His Holy Spirit, and with His
Word in our hands have we invaded the enemy’s camp, and
pursued him with earnest self-denying zeal? Have we fought
and conquered our Midianites by the power of living faith?</p>

<p>Or, to change the metaphor, has faith been with us as
the blighted tree, on which the sunshine falls in vain,
which stands a bare form, a lifeless thing, when spring
clothes all around it with verdure? Has the Lord of
the vineyard said of it, <i>Lo, these three</i>, or ten, or twenty
<i>years I come seeking fruit, and finding none. Cut it
down; why cumbereth it the ground?</i> Oh, my
brethren, that faith which is shown not by deeds, that
faith which works not by love, is <i>not</i> the faith which is
firmly rooted in the Rock of Ages. A cold assent of the
reason is not faith, a lifeless profession is not faith; that
is faith which beareth good fruits—that which, like the
faith of Gideon, overcometh the enemy.</p>

<p>We have to pursue our Midianites to the Jordan, but
not beyond Jordan. At the fords of the “narrow stream
of death” the last enemy will perish for ever. Into the
bright land beyond, Disappointment, Discontent cannot
enter; for there is the fulness of joy and pleasures for
evermore. Dissension is unknown where every look and
thought are love; nor can the shadow of Distrust fall in
the realm of eternal light, for the servants of Christ shall
<i>see Him as He is</i>, and dwell with Him in bliss everlasting.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Months had rolled away, months crowded with
incidents of interest to the personages in my
story, and now Edith and Isa stand again on
the summit of the grassy mound by Castle
Lestrange, which overlooks a landscape so
wide and so fair. They behold Nature no longer clad in
the light-green drapery of spring, spangled with blossoms,
but in the rich full foliage of summer, which the setting
sun is bathing in golden glory. Edith’s blue eyes are
gazing on the magnificent sky, where the bright orb of
day, while sinking down on a throne of fiery clouds,
is throwing upwards widening streams of light where
rosy clouds, like islands of the blessed, softly float in
clear blue ether. Never, even in Italy, had Edith
witnessed a finer sunset; it seemed like a glimpse
granted to mortals below of the coming glories of
heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>“How resplendent is the sky!” exclaimed Edith, after
a pause of silent admiration.</p>

<p>“And how beautiful the earth!” added Isa.</p>

<p>“Ah, on the eve of your bridal day, dearest, the prospect
may well look fair in your eyes, but still it owes
its chief beauty to the radiance above it.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus28.jpg" width="500" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A FAIR PROSPECT.</p>
</div>

<p>“I think that it must always be so to the Christian,”
observed Isa. “The very crown of earthly happiness is
to think that it is not all earthly; that our Lord, who
has joined our hearts together, will also join our hands;
and that the union which He makes will endure when
that sun itself is dark!” Isa’s eyes glistened with tears
as she spoke, but they welled up from a deep fount of joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span></p>

<p>“Just look towards Wildwaste!” cried Edith; “they
have finished that triumphal arch of evergreens and
roses at which Lottie and her brother, and all the children
of the hamlet, have been working so hard since
daybreak. I never thought that Wildwaste could put
on an appearance so bright and so gay. Every
cottage has its garland, and I should not wonder if
the manufactory itself burst into an illumination to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I suspect that the enthusiasm and the rejoicing,”
said Isa gayly, “is less on account of the wedding than
to express the joy of the hamlet at Arthur Madden’s
being appointed to succeed Mr. Bull. Old Bolder was
speaking so warmly on the subject this morning. ‘There
will be good days for Wildwaste yet,’ he said, ‘now that
we’ve a pastor who will work, and pray while he works;
who loves his people, and will make them love him!
We’ll not have all the drunkenness and riot which have
made Wildwaste a blot on the land! I’ve felt better
ever since I heard the good news,’ he added, rubbing his
hands; ‘and I’ll make a shift, I will, to throw away my
crutches, and get to church the day that Mr. Arthur gives
his first sermon.’”</p>

<p>“Every one welcomes their young clergyman as the
benefactor of the place,” observed Edith.</p>

<p>“Lottie would be almost sorry to leave Wildwaste,”
said Isa, “were she not going with me to Axe, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
she will be close to her widowed mother, and able often
to be with her.”</p>

<p>“The only person for whom I feel sorry in the midst
of all this rejoicing,” observed Edith, “is your poor
brother, Mr. Gritton. He will miss you so sadly, when
all alone in that dreary house at Wildwaste.”</p>

<p>“I suspect that he will not be long alone,” said Isa.</p>

<p>“What!—is it true then?” asked Edith quickly, glancing
up into the face of her companion; “but surely,
surely it must grieve you to think of having Cora Madden
as a sister!”</p>

<p>“Some months ago it would have grieved me inexpressibly,”
replied Isa gravely. “I should have deemed
such a connection a heavy misfortune; but Cora is
changed, so much changed, since her illness.”</p>

<p>“I hear that the small-pox has left deep traces—”</p>

<p>“Yes, on her character,” interrupted Isa. “Cora is
much softened, I hope humbled; there is so much less
of asperity in her manner, of sarcasm in her tone. Is it
not strange, Edith, that she of whom I once spoke so
harshly when you and I stood here conversing together,
should seem now to turn towards me with the affection
of a sister?”</p>

<p>“You have indeed been a sister to her, dear Isa; often
have I wondered at your courage in braving infection,
and your unselfishness in enduring quarantine, and all
for one whom you dis——whom you could not love.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
But yours was the courage, the self-devotion of faith, and
God guarded you from the danger.”</p>

<p>“God has indeed crowned me with loving-kindness
and tender mercies!” exclaimed Isa, whose quick eye
had caught sight at that moment of a well-known form
advancing up the avenue. All her cares and fears, all
her difficulties and trials, had now been exchanged for
exceeding joy; every cloud in her sky, like those round
the sun, had become a golden mansion of light.</p>

<p>Shall earth be called only “a vale of tears,” and all
its hopes be compared to a withering leaf? Is happiness
below but a fading vision? Not so; for even here the
Almighty can throw sunshine around His children, and
sweeten their cup with drops from that fountain of bliss
whose full stream shall refresh their spirits above! But
for whom is such happiness prepared? Not for the fearful
and unbelieving, not for the selfish and self-willed,
but for those who, like Gideon, have obeyed God’s
word and chosen His service, and rendered faithful
obedience to Him whose mercy hath redeemed them.
The Christian must not look for the victory without the
struggle, nor hope for peace while the smallest sin retains
dominion within the soul; it is on the night of
conflict that dawns the morn of success; to God’s faithful
warriors, <i>faint, yet pursuing</i>, was given the triumph
of faith over Midian!</p>
